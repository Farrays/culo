  "dancehallCulturalFull": "### The Origins: Kingston, Jamaica (1970s-1980s)\n\nDancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 1970s. It emerged as a natural evolution of reggae when sound systems (mobile sound systems) started bringing music to the streets and dancehalls (dance halls). The name \"dancehall\" comes from those spaces where the community gathered to dance, socialize, and express themselves. It was the place where social tensions were released through music and movement.\n\n### The Legends: Bogle, Passa Passa, and the Pioneers\n\n**Gerald \"Bogle\" Levy (1964-2005) is considered the father of modern Dancehall.** He created iconic moves like **Bogle, Row Di Boat, Log On, and Willie Bounce**, the foundation of Dancehall vocabulary.\n\n**Passa Passa**, the legendary street dancehall sessions in Tivoli Gardens (Kingston), was the epicenter where new steps were born and dancers were consecrated.\n\nOther pioneers like **Ding Dong, Keiva, John Hype** and crews like **Ravers Clavers** took Dancehall to an international level in the 2000s.\n\n### The Global Expansion (2000s-Present)\n\nIn the 2000s, Dancehall exploded globally thanks to artists like **Sean Paul, Shaggy, Elephant Man, and Beenie Man**. Social media and YouTube popularized moves like **Dutty Wine, Daggering, and Nuh Linga**.\n\nToday, Dancehall is a worldwide phenomenon with active communities in Europe, Africa, Asia, and America; Barcelona is one of its European epicenters.\n\n### The Music: Riddims and Sound System Culture\n\n**Dancehall is danced to riddims (instrumental tracks) that producers create and multiple artists vocalize.** Legendary riddims like **Diwali, Coolie Dance, or Dump Truck** defined entire eras.\n\nThe sound system culture—with its selectors, MCs, and the famous rewind when a song is so good it gets played again from the beginning—is essential to understanding Dancehall.\n\n### More Than Dance: Identity and Resistance\n\nDancehall has always been a form of cultural resistance and identity expression for Jamaica's marginalized communities. It's the voice of the ghettos, a celebration of joy despite difficulties.\n\nEach step has meaning: **Log On** (connect), **Willie Bounce** (tribute to Willie Haggart), **Nuh Linga** (don't linger). Every movement tells a story.\n\n### Dancehall at Farray's: technique and community\n\nAt Farray's International Dance Center, Dancehall is taught with technique, respect, and historical context, prioritizing good energy, movement precision, and a professional environment.",
