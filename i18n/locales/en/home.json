  "manifesto_line3": "YOUR TOMORROW",
  "classesFaqQ1": "How many dance styles do you teach at Farray's Center?",
  "classesFaqA1": "We offer training in over 25 different dance styles. Our catalog includes Latin dances (salsa, bachata, kizomba), urban dance (hip hop, dancehall, afrobeats, reggaeton), classical styles (ballet, contemporary, jazz), and specializations like physical preparation for dancers. This variety allows you to explore different styles and find those that resonate most with you, or specialize in one while complementing with others.",
  "classesFaqQ2": "Can I take classes in different styles at the same time?",
  "classesFaqA2": "Of course! In fact, we recommend it. Learning multiple dance styles makes you a more complete and versatile dancer. For example, ballet improves your posture and technique for salsa, while hip hop can make your bachata more dynamic. Our class packages allow you to attend different types of classes according to your interests. Many of our most advanced students practice 3-4 styles simultaneously.",
  "classesFaqQ3": "How do I know which level is right for me?",
  "classesFaqA3": "If it's your first class, we always recommend starting at the fundamentals or beginner level. However, if you have previous dance experience, our instructors can assess you in your first welcome class and recommend the most appropriate level. You can also try an intermediate level class if you feel the fundamentals are too basic. The important thing is that you feel challenged but not overwhelmed.",
  "classesFaqQ4": "How often should I attend classes to see progress?",
  "classesFaqA4": "For consistent and noticeable progress, we recommend attending at least twice a week. At this frequency, most students see significant improvements in 2-3 months. If you can attend 3-4 times a week, progress will be even faster. However, even a weekly class will allow you to advance, albeit at a more gradual pace. Consistency is more important than intensity.",
  "classesFaqQ5": "Do you offer private or only group classes?",
  "classesFaqA5": "We offer both options. Group classes are excellent for learning in community, making friends, and benefiting from the group's energy. Private classes are ideal if you seek personalized attention, have specific goals (like preparing for a presentation or wedding), or prefer a more flexible schedule. Many students combine both: regular group classes supplemented with occasional private sessions to work on specific aspects.",
