  "homeFaqQ1": "Where is the academy located and how do I get there?",
  "homeFaqA1": "Farray's International Dance Center is at Calle Entença 100, Barcelona (08015), just 5 minutes walking from Plaza España and Sants Station. It's easily accessible by metro (lines L1, L3, L5), bus, and train. The neighborhood has excellent connections throughout Barcelona. You'll find our center in a vibrant area with cafes and shops all around.",
  "homeFaqQ2": "What sets Farray's apart from other dance academies in Barcelona?",
  "homeFaqA2": "Farray's is not just another school: it was born from a love story for dance. We renovated a space abandoned for 10 years with our own hands because the school we dreamed of didn't exist. We're accredited by CID-UNESCO, we use the exclusive Farray Method® created by Yunaisy (dancer in Street Dance 2 and Got Talent), and above all, every student matters here. You're not a number: you're part of the family.",
  "homeFaqQ3": "What's the atmosphere like at the academy?",
  "homeFaqA3": "When we say family is in the air here, it's not a slogan—it's the truth. From day one you feel welcomed. Our students come from all levels and ages, and the atmosphere is inclusive, motivating, and full of positive energy. Many come for the dance and stay for the community. We do events, performances, and even outings together. It's your dance tribe.",
  "homeFaqQ4": "What dance styles can I learn at Farray's?",
  "homeFaqA4": "We're truly multidisciplinary: Salsa, Bachata, Kizomba, Dancehall, Hip Hop, Reggaeton, Commercial Dance, Ballet, Jazz, Contemporary, Heels, and more. From Latin rhythms to urban and classical dance. The Farray Method® fuses all of this with a unique pedagogy that combines Russian discipline, Afro-descendant flavor, and global innovation. Here you find your style... or discover several.",
  "homeFaqQ5": "Do I need previous experience to start?",
  "homeFaqA5": "Not at all. We have classes from absolute beginner level to advanced/professional. The Farray Method® is designed for you to progress quickly regardless of your starting point. Many of our best students started without ever having danced. What matters is wanting to learn and enjoy. Your welcome class is special so you can try it without commitment.",
  "homeFaqQ6": "Do you offer performances, events, or shows?",
  "homeFaqA6": "Yes! We organize showcases in professional theaters, participate in Barcelona cultural events, competitions, workshops with international teachers, and themed parties. If you want to get on stage, here's your chance. And if you prefer just to enjoy dancing, that's perfect too. You decide your level of involvement.",
  "homeFaqQ7": "What is CID-UNESCO and why is it important?",
  "homeFaqA7": "CID-UNESCO (International Dance Council) is the official UNESCO organization for dance worldwide. That Farray's is accredited by them means we meet the highest international teaching standards. Yunaisy Farray is an active member. This guarantees pedagogical quality, international recognition, and serious professionalism.",
  "homeFaqQ8": "Can I try a dance class before enrolling?",
  "homeFaqA8": "Depending on the season, the welcome class for residents has a special welcome price. The idea is that you can try the experience without commitment. Book your spot by clicking the \"Book Your Welcome Class\" button at the top of this page.",

  "dancehallFaqQ1": "What exactly is dancehall?",
  "dancehallFaqA1": "Dancehall is a style of music and dance that originated in Jamaica in the 70s. It's characterized by energetic movements, powerful rhythms ('riddims'), and a bold, confident attitude. It's much more than just steps: it's a complete cultural expression with its own history, music, and community. In our classes, you don't just learn the movements but also the culture and context behind them.",
  "dancehallFaqQ2": "Is dancehall difficult to learn?",
  "dancehallFaqA2": "No more than any other dance style. Dancehall may seem intimidating at first due to its energy and rhythm, but our pedagogical approach breaks down each movement step by step. We start with the fundamentals (grooves, basic riddims) and advance gradually. Most of our beginner students are dancing full choreographies within a few weeks. The most important thing is attitude and the desire to have fun.",
  "dancehallFaqQ3": "Do I need to be in shape for dancehall classes?",
  "dancehallFaqA3": "You don't need to be in specific shape to start. Dancehall itself is an excellent cardiovascular and endurance workout, so you'll improve your physical condition with each class. We work at different intensities and you can always adapt the movements to your current level. The important thing is to listen to your body and progress at your own pace.",
  "dancehallFaqQ4": "What should I wear to dancehall class?",
  "dancehallFaqA4": "Comfortable, sporty clothing that allows you to move freely. Many students wear athletic pants or leggings and a t-shirt. For footwear, clean athletic shoes with good soles are ideal. Bring a water bottle because you're going to sweat! Optional: a small towel and your best attitude.",

  "dhV3WhatIsP2": "Dancehall is much more than a dance: it's a way of walking, talking, and understanding life; a declaration of who you are. It's pure expression, rhythm, attitude, and flow. In Dancehall you don't have to be good, you have to be yourself.",

  "dhV3WhatIsQuestionTitle": "Wondering if it's for you?",
  "dhV3WhatIsQuestionAnswer": "Yes, it is.",
  "dhV3CulturalTitle": "Dancehall History and Culture",
  "dhV3CulturalShort": "Dancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston (Jamaica) in the late 70s as an evolution of reggae, driven by sound systems in streets and dancehalls, community spaces to dance and release social tensions.",
  "dhV3CulturalFull": "### The origins: Kingston, Jamaica (1970s–1980s)\\n\\nDancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 70s. It emerged as a natural evolution of reggae when sound systems (mobile sound systems) began taking music to the streets and dancehalls. The name \\\"dancehall\\\" comes from those spaces where the community gathered to dance, socialize, and express themselves. It was where social tensions were released through music and movement.\\n\\n### The legends: Bogle, Passa Passa, and the pioneers\\n\\n**Gerald \\\"Bogle\\\" Levy (1964–2005) is considered the father of modern Dancehall.** He created iconic moves like **Bogle, Row Di Boat, Log On, and Willie Bounce**, the foundation of the Dancehall vocabulary.\\n\\n**Passa Passa**, the legendary street dancehall sessions in Tivoli Gardens (Kingston), was the epicenter where new steps were born and dancers were consecrated.\\n\\nOther pioneers like **Ding Dong, Keiva, John Hype** and crews like **Ravers Clavers** took Dancehall international in the 2000s.\\n\\n**\\\"Gerald 'Bogle' Levy is the father of modern Dancehall with iconic steps like Bogle, Row Di Boat and Log On; Passa Passa in Tivoli Gardens (Kingston) was the street dancehall epicenter where trends were born.\\\"**\\n\\n### Global expansion (2000s–present)\\n\\nIn the 2000s, Dancehall exploded globally thanks to artists like **Sean Paul, Shaggy, Elephant Man, and Beenie Man**. Social media and YouTube popularized steps like **Dutty Wine, Daggering, and Nuh Linga**.\\n\\n**Since the 2000s, artists like Sean Paul and Elephant Man, along with YouTube and social media, globalized Dancehall with steps like Dutty Wine and Daggering; today it has strong communities in Europe (Barcelona as epicenter), Africa, Asia and America.**\\n\\nToday, Dancehall is a worldwide phenomenon with active communities in Europe, Africa, Asia, and America; Barcelona is one of its European epicenters.\\n\\n### The music: Riddims and Sound System culture\\n\\n**Dancehall is danced to riddims (instrumental bases) that producers create and multiple artists voice over.** Legendary riddims like **Diwali, Coolie Dance, or Dump Truck** defined entire eras.\\n\\n**\\\"Dancehall is danced to legendary riddims like Diwali or Coolie Dance, with sound system culture of selectors, MCs and rewinds; multiple artists voice over the same instrumental base, defining eras.\\\"**\\n\\nSound system culture—with its selectors, MCs, and the famous rewind when a song is so good it gets replayed from the start—is essential to understanding Dancehall.\\n\\n### More than dance: identity and resistance\\n\\nDancehall has always been a form of cultural resistance and identity expression for Jamaica's marginalized communities. It's the voice of the ghettos, a celebration of joy despite difficulties.\\n\\n**\\\"Dancehall is cultural resistance from Jamaican ghettos, with steps loaded with meaning like Log On ('connect') or Nuh Linga ('don't delay'), celebrating joy and identity despite difficulties.\\\"**\\n\\nEach step has meaning: **Log On** (connect), **Willie Bounce** (tribute to Willie Haggart), **Nuh Linga** (don't delay). Every movement tells a story.\\n\\n### Dancehall at Farray's: technique and community\\n\\nAt Farray's International Dance Center, Dancehall is taught with technique, respect and historical context, prioritizing good energy, movement precision and a professional environment.\\n\\n**Scientific studies on dance indicate that dancing improves coordination, proprioception and overall physical condition, as well as reducing stress and improving mood, and Dancehall benefits from these effects due to its high energy and complete body work.**\\n\\n**An active Dancehall class can burn 300-480 calories per hour depending on weight and intensity, similar to other high-demand aerobic dances.**\\n\\n**Scientific reviews associate regular dancing with lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia, highlighting its value as brain training in dynamic styles like Dancehall.**\\n\\n**Farray's International Dance Center offers Dancehall classes in a school rated close to 5/5 on Google with hundreds of positive reviews.**",

  "danzasUrbanas_whatIs_title": "What is Urban Dance?",
  "danzasUrbanas_whatIs_definition": "Urban dances are dance styles born in the streets, plazas and neighborhoods of different cities around the world.

  "danzasUrbanas_whatIs_origin": "The term \"urban dance\" groups a huge family of styles that share common DNA: they were born from popular culture, transmitted by imitation in the streets and evolved with contemporary urban music (rap, reggae, dancehall, trap, afrobeats). Unlike classical dance (ballet, contemporary, jazz), urban dances prioritize groove, musicality, attitude and personal expression over academic technique.",

  "danzasUrbanas_whatIs_difference_commercial": "Commercial Dance: Urban style choreographed and polished for the entertainment industry: music videos, concerts, TV shows. Mixes technique from different urban styles with elements of jazz, contemporary and commercial influences. E.g.: K-Pop choreographies, Heels, mainstream artist music videos.",
  "danzasUrbanas_whatIs_why_many_styles": "So many different styles exist because each was born in a unique cultural, geographical and musical context. Hip Hop emerged in the Bronx, New York with rap culture and breakdancing. Dancehall was born in Jamaica with soundsystems and reggae music. K-Pop evolved in South Korea fusing Western pop with Asian aesthetics. Afrobeat connects with modern African rhythms from Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa.

We also offer individual Lady Style and Men Style classes if you prefer to focus on your personal technique.",
  "salsaBachataFaqQ3": "What's the difference between Cuban Salsa and other salsa styles?",
  "salsaBachataFaqA3": "Cuban Salsa is danced in a circle and has a more circular, joyful and \"street\" style compared to Salsa on Line (LA Style or NY Style). Cuban incorporates Afro-Cuban, son and rumba movements. It\\'s very social: you can dance in rueda de casino (several dancers in a circle) or in pairs. At Farray\\'s we teach authentic Cuban salsa with teachers from Havana.",
  "salsaBachataFaqQ4": "What level do I need to start salsa or bachata classes?",
  "salsaBachataFaqA4": "None. We have classes for all levels: Beginner (you've never danced), Basic (you know the basic steps), Intermediate (you dance fluently and know figures) and Advanced (you master technique and musicality). If you've never danced salsa or bachata, start in our Beginner classes where we teach you from scratch: basic step, musical timing, partner connection and first figures.",
  "salsaBachataFaqQ5": "How long does it take to learn to dance salsa or bachata?",
  "salsaBachataFaqA5": "It depends on your dedication, but with consistent practice (2-3 classes per week) you can dance confidently in 2-3 months. To master the technique, advanced musicality and complex figures, we recommend at least 6-12 months. Many of our advanced students have been perfecting their style for years and never stop learning. What's important is to enjoy the process from day one.",
  "salsaBachataFaqQ6": "What's the difference between Sensual Bachata and Bachata Lady Style?",
  "salsaBachataFaqA6": "Sensual Bachata is danced in pairs with connection, body waves, dips and isolations inspired by zouk and contemporary. Bachata Lady Style focuses on individual feminine dancing: footwork technique, hip movement, arms, waves and attitude, perfect for shining alone on the dance floor or perfecting your technique before partner dancing. Both complement each other: Sensual for connection, Lady Style for personal technique.",
  "salsaBachataFaqQ7": "Do salsa and bachata classes include live music?",
  "salsaBachataFaqA7": "Our regular classes use recorded music from the best salsa and bachata artists (Celia Cruz, El Gran Combo, Marc Anthony, Romeo Santos, Prince Royce, etc.). However, we organize special events, Latin parties and workshops with live musicians where you can practice what you've learned in a festive and authentic atmosphere. We also collaborate with salsa festivals in Barcelona.",
  "salsaBachataFaqQ8": "Do you offer Rueda de Casino classes?",
  "salsaBachataFaqA8": "Yes, Rueda de Casino is an integral part of our Cuban Salsa classes. Rueda is a modality where multiple couples dance in a circle and a \"cantante\" (caller) announces the figures that everyone executes at the same time. It\\'s very fun, social and traditional in Cuba. To dance rueda you need to first master the basic steps of Cuban salsa and the main figures.",

  "salsaBachata_whatIs_title": "What is Salsa Cubana and Bachata?",
  "salsaBachata_whatIs_salsa": "Salsa Cubana is much more than a dance: it's a cultural expression born in Cuba that fuses Afro-Caribbean rhythms (son, rumba, mambo, cha-cha-cha) with jazz and other styles. It's characterized by circular movements in pairs (rueda de casino), quick footwork, free body expression and a deep connection with the music. It's the most social and festive salsa style, perfect for group dancing and enjoying improvisation.",
  "salsaBachata_whatIs_bachata": "Bachata is a sensual and romantic dance originating from the Dominican Republic. It was born in working-class neighborhoods in the 1960s and evolved to become one of the most popular Latin dances in the world. It's danced in pairs with marked hip movements, simple basic steps (side-to-side with tap) and fluid turns. There are several styles: Dominican Bachata (traditional), Sensual Bachata (modern, with body waves) and Bachata Fusion.",
  "salsaBachata_whatIs_difference_title": "Difference between Salsa Cubana and Salsa on Line",
  "salsaBachata_whatIs_difference_text": "Salsa Cubana is danced in a circle (rueda de casino), with freer and more Afro-Caribbean movements, ideal for parties and social dancing. Salsa on Line (LA or New York style) is danced in a straight line, with more technical choreographies and spectacular turns, perfect for shows and exhibitions. Both styles share the same music, but the dancing philosophy is different.",
  "salsaBachata_whatIs_benefits": "Dancing Salsa and Bachata improves your coordination, rhythm, cardiovascular fitness, social confidence and cultural connection.

  "twerkWhatIsP2": "In Barcelona, Twerk has exploded as a form of fitness, female empowerment, and connection with urban music. It's not just moving your hips: it's technique, control, musicality, and attitude. It's sweat, laughter, and liberation.",

  "twerkWhatIsQuestionTitle": "Wondering if it's for you?",
  "twerkWhatIsQuestionAnswer": "Yes, it is.",
  "twerkCulturalHistoryTitle": "Want to know more about Twerk?",
  "twerkCulturalShort": "Twerk is an urban dance style characterized by rhythmic hip and glute movements, originating from New Orleans bounce culture (USA) in the late 1980s. It combines influences from Afro-descendant dances like the mapouka from Ivory Coast and Afro-Caribbean traditions. In Barcelona, Farray's International Dance Center (Entença 100, Eixample) has been a reference for Twerk instruction since 2012.",
  "twerkCulturalFull": "### Definition: What is Twerk?\\n\\n**Twerk is an urban dance style characterized by rhythmic, isolated movements of the hips, pelvis and glutes, executed with muscular control and coordination over urban music bases.** Born in the New Orleans bounce scene (Louisiana, USA) between 1989 and 1993, Twerk fuses influences from traditional West African dances —such as the mapouka from Ivory Coast— with African-American hip hop culture from the southern United States.\\n\\n### The Origins: Africa, Caribbean and the Southern U.S.\\n\\nTwerk didn\\'t appear overnight. It was born from a mix of Afro-descendant influences: movements from traditional African dances like \"mapouka\" (West Africa), from New Orleans bounce culture and other urban styles that already worked a lot on the hips and the \"booty\".\\n\\nBefore Instagram existed and before anyone labeled it \"twerk\", there were already women (and men) moving their hips and glutes in African and Caribbean dances, linked to rituals, celebrations and popular festivals. With the arrival of these peoples to the United States, that body memory mixed with new music and contexts. In the south of the country, especially in New Orleans, that mix exploded.\\n\\n### New Orleans Bounce (1989-1993): Where Twerk Gets Its Name and Attitude\\n\\nModern Twerk as we know it is closely linked to **New Orleans Bounce**, a hip hop subgenre born in the late 80s and early 90s. In the clubs and block parties of the city, the audience —especially Black women— began to develop a dance style focused on glute, leg and pelvis work, with lots of energy, endurance and attitude.\\n\\nArtists like **DJ Jubilee** (author of \"Do the Jubilee All\", 1993), **Big Freedia** and **Cheeky Blakk** helped popularize that sound and those movements. That\\'s where Twerk stops being \"just another step\" and becomes its own style: physical, explosive and unapologetically free.\\n\\n### Physical Benefits of Twerk\\n\\nAccording to scientific literature on physical activity and dance:\\n\\n- **Caloric expenditure:** A moderate-to-high intensity dance session can burn between 300 and 600 kcal/hour depending on body weight, intensity and duration (American Council on Exercise).\\n- **Muscle strengthening:** Twerk specifically works the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, quadriceps, hamstrings and core, contributing to lower body toning.\\n- **Coordination and proprioception:** Regular dance practice improves motor coordination and body awareness.\\n- **Mental health:** Studies published in *Frontiers in Psychology* (2021) associate regular dance practice with reduced anxiety symptoms and improved mood.\\n\\n### From the Clubs to the World: Global Expansion of Twerk\\n\\nFrom the 2000s, with the power of music videos and, later, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, Twerk went global. It appeared in mainstream artist videos, on tours of major pop stars and on stages around the world.\\n\\n**Since the 2000s, driven by music videos and social media, Twerk went from being a dance linked to clubs and block parties in the southern U.S. to a global phenomenon present in mainstream videos, dance schools, battles and workshops in Europe and Latin America.**\\n\\nIn Europe and Latin America it crossed with other styles like Dancehall, Reggaeton and Hip Hop, and Twerk schools, battles and workshops started popping up everywhere. Today, Twerk is no longer \"just a trend\": it has technique, schools, competitions and its own pedagogy.\\n\\n### The Music of Twerk: Bounce, Hip Hop, Trap and More\\n\\n**Although Twerk is strongly linked to New Orleans bounce, today it\\'s also danced to hip hop, trap, dancehall, afrobeats, reggaeton and other urban rhythms, always seeking a marked beat and pumping sensation that facilitates bounces and rhythm changes.**\\n\\nEach beat invites a different type of energy: more aggressive, more sensual or more festive.\\n\\n### Much More Than Moving Your Glutes: Body, Identity and Power\\n\\nReducing Twerk to \"moving your butt\" is to understand absolutely nothing. **In the context of professional schools, Twerk is taught as comprehensive training: body awareness, leg, core and glute strength, coordination, self-esteem and empowerment, helping students reconcile with their body and decide how they want to show themselves.**\\n\\nTwerk, as we teach it at Farray\\'s, is about: **body awareness** (learning to isolate, control and protect your body), **physical strength** (strong legs, core and glutes; endurance and coordination), **identity and self-esteem** (reconciling with your body, your shape, your rhythm and your desire), and **empowerment** (deciding how you move, how you show yourself and what story your dance tells).\\n\\n### Twerk Classes in Barcelona: Farray\\'s International Dance Center\\n\\n**Farray\\'s International Dance Center**, located at **Calle Entença 100, Eixample district, Barcelona (08015)**, has been offering Twerk classes since 2012. The academy is recognized by **CID UNESCO** (International Dance Council) and directed by **Yunaisy Farray**, professional dancer and actress in the film *Street Dance 2* (2012).\\n\\n**Verifiable academy data:**\\n- **Address:** Calle Entença 100, 08015 Barcelona, Spain\\n- **Access:** Metro L1/L3 (Plaça Espanya), L5 (Entença), Rodalies (Barcelona-Sants)\\n- **Google Rating:** 4.9/5 with over 500 verified reviews\\n- **Recognition:** CID UNESCO member\\n- **Twerk Schedule:** Classes Monday through Friday at beginner, basic and intermediate levels\\n\\nTwerk is taught at Farray\\'s with technique, respect and historical context: it\\'s not a spectacle for filming \"attention-grabbing\" videos, but a tool for gaining strength, confidence and stage presence, in a professional, inclusive environment close to Barcelona\\'s best transport connections.",

  "afroCulturalTitle": "History and culture of Afrobeats and Afrodance",
  "afroCulturalShort": "Afrobeats emerged in the late 90s in Nigeria and Ghana as an urban fusion of African rhythms, highlife, hip hop, R&B and dancehall, creating marked percussion and global melodies.",
  "afroCulturalFull": "### Origins: Lagos, Accra and the New African Wave\n\nAfrobeats (plural) emerged in the late 90s and early 2000s between Nigeria and Ghana. It is not a single genre, but an urban current that mixes African rhythms with highlife, hip hop, R&B, dancehall and pop. The result is a recognizable sound: marked percussion, powerful bass, catchy melodies and unforgettable choruses.\n\n**\"Afrobeats emerged in the late 90s in Nigeria and Ghana as an urban fusion of African rhythms, highlife, hip hop, R&B and dancehall, creating marked percussion and global melodies.\"**\n\n### From Fela Kuti to Current Afrobeats\n\nBefore this modern wave, in the 60s and 70s, Fela Kuti revolutionized Nigerian music originating Afrobeat (singular): a fusion of jazz, funk, highlife and Yoruba rhythms with messages of social and political protest, extended songs and immersive instrumental structures. Current Afrobeats takes rhythmic elements from Afrobeat, but adapts them to shorter songs, digital production and an orientation to international consumption for radio and clubs.\n\n**\"From Fela Kuti's Afrobeat (60-70s, jazz-funk-protest) to modern Afrobeats: short songs, digital production and global focus, maintaining Yoruba and Nigerian highlife rhythms.\"**\n\n### From Sound to Movement: Afrodance\n\nThe musical rise of Afrobeats brought new dance forms: what is now defined as Afrodance or afro urban dances. These movements were born in streets and clubs of Lagos, Accra or Johannesburg, and some viral examples have been:\n\n• **Azonto** (Ghana): hips, shoulders and everyday gestures.\n• **Etighi, Shoki, Shaku Shaku, Zanku/Legwork** (Nigeria): intense footwork, knee bounce and relaxed arms.\n\nThese dances go viral globally through YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. Additionally, from Gabon has recently emerged **Ntcham or Tcham Bolo**, a musical and urban dance expression originating in the popular neighborhoods and prisons of Libreville.\n\n**\"Afrodance includes Azonto (Ghana: hips-gestures), Shaku Shaku/Zanku (Nigeria: feet-bounce), and Ntcham (Gabon: urban roots), viralized by YouTube, TikTok and Instagram from the streets of Lagos and Accra.\"**\n\n### Global Expansion: From Lagos to Barcelona\n\nSince the 2000s, artists like **Wizkid, Davido, Tiwa Savage and Burna Boy** have taken Afrobeats out of Africa, collaborating with international pop and rap stars. Festivals, clubs and digital platforms have transformed this genre into a symbol of new African culture, influencing music, dance, fashion and attitude worldwide. In cities like Barcelona, the Afrodance community is growing rapidly.\n\n**\"Artists like Wizkid, Davido and Burna Boy globalized Afrobeats since the 2000s with pop/rap collaborations; it influences festivals, clubs and cities like Barcelona, symbol of modern African culture.\"**\n\n### More than a Trend: Identity and Community\n\nAlthough Afrodance may be seen a lot on social media, its root is deep: it is a manifestation of pride, joy, humor, sensuality and African feeling. Each step breathes intention: play, power, enjoyment. Afrobeats and Afrodance connect with the basic instinct to move, share energy, and feel part of a global identity, even if you are far from Lagos or Accra.\n\n**\"Afrobeats/Afrodance express African pride, joy, sensuality and global community; each step carries intention of play, power and connection, beyond social media.\"**\n\n### Afrobeats at Farray's: technique and community\n\nAt Farray's International Dance Center, Afrobeats is taught with technique, respect and cultural context, prioritizing flow, bounce and collective energy in a professional environment.\n\n**Scientific studies on dance indicate that dancing improves coordination, proprioception and overall physical condition, as well as reducing stress and improving mood, and Afrobeats benefits from these effects due to its marked percussion and feet/hips work.**\n\n**An active Afrobeats class can burn 300-480 calories per hour depending on weight and intensity, similar to aerobic dances with high bounce and flow.**\n\n**Scientific reviews associate regular dancing with lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia, highlighting its brain value in dynamic styles like Afrobeats.**\n\n**Farray's International Dance Center offers Afrobeats classes in a school rated close to 5/5 on Google with hundreds of positive reviews.**",

  "hhrCulturalFull": "### The Origins of Hip Hop: South Bronx, New York (1973)\n\n**On August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc hosted a party at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the South Bronx, New York, considered the official birth of Hip Hop.** Clive Campbell (DJ Kool Herc), a Jamaican immigrant, introduced the technique of isolating and extending the instrumental \"breaks\" from funk and soul records, creating a new sound that invited dancing.\n\n**\"Hip Hop was born on August 11, 1973, in the South Bronx of New York, when DJ Kool Herc isolated funk record breaks at a party at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue.\"**\n\nAfrican-American and Latino communities in the Bronx developed the **four fundamental pillars of Hip Hop**: DJing (turntablism), MCing (rap), B-boying/B-girling (breaking), and Graffiti (visual urban art).\n\n### Hip Hop Dance Pioneers\n\nLegendary groups established the techniques that define Hip Hop dance today:\n\n- **The Lockers (1973)**: Don Campbell created Locking in Los Angeles\n- **Electric Boogaloos (1977)**: Boogaloo Sam developed Popping in Fresno, California\n- **The Rock Steady Crew (1977)**: Breaking pioneers in the Bronx\n\n**\"The Rock Steady Crew (1977) and Electric Boogaloos (1977) established the technical foundations of breaking and popping taught in academies worldwide today.\"**\n\n**At the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, breaking was included as an official Olympic discipline**, recognizing over 50 years of technical and artistic development in Hip Hop.\n\n### Reggaeton: From Puerto Rico to the World (1990s)\n\n**Reggaeton emerged in Puerto Rico in the early 1990s, fusing Jamaican reggae, American hip-hop, and Latin rhythms.** Producers like DJ Playero and artists like Vico C were pioneers of the Puerto Rican \"underground\" movement.\n\n**The characteristic \"dembow\" rhythm comes from the track \"Dem Bow\" (1990) by Jamaican artist Shabba Ranks**, produced by Bobby \"Digital\" Dixon. This rhythmic pattern became the foundation of reggaeton.\n\n**\"The reggaeton dembow rhythm comes from the track Dem Bow (1990) by Shabba Ranks; Daddy Yankee popularized it globally with Gasolina (2004).\"**\n\n**In 2004, \"Gasolina\" by Daddy Yankee marked the international breakthrough of reggaeton.** Artists like Don Omar, Tego Calderón, Wisin & Yandel, and Ivy Queen consolidated the genre on the world stage.\n\n**\"Despacito\" (2017) by Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee** became the first video to reach 7 billion views on YouTube, demonstrating reggaeton's global reach.\n\n### The Hip Hop Reggaeton Fusion\n\nThe fusion of Hip Hop and Reggaeton represents the natural evolution of both genres. Contemporary artists like Bad Bunny, J Balvin, and Rosalía combine elements of both styles, creating a hybrid sound that dominates global charts.\n\n**\"Hip Hop Reggaeton fusion combines the technique and swagger of hip-hop with the sensuality and rhythm of reggaeton, representing the evolution of 21st-century urban dance.\"**\n\nThis fusion incorporates:\n- **From Hip Hop**: Grooves, bounces, isolations, footwork, and attitude\n- **From Reggaeton**: Hip movement, dembow, sensuality, and Latin flow\n\n### Barcelona: European Urban Dance Hub\n\n**Barcelona has established itself as one of the main urban dance centers in Europe.** The city attracts dancers from across the continent for its vibrant cultural scene and climate that favors outdoor life.\n\n**Farray's International Dance Center, located in the Eixample district (Calle Entença 100, Barcelona)**, offers Hip Hop Reggaeton classes at an academy accredited by the CID-UNESCO (International Dance Council of UNESCO in Paris).\n\n### Physical and Mental Benefits\n\n**Scientific studies on dance demonstrate that dancing improves coordination, proprioception, and cardiovascular condition, as well as reducing stress and improving mood.**\n\n**A 60-minute Hip Hop Reggaeton class can burn between 400-600 calories**, depending on intensity and body weight, similar to other high-demand aerobic exercises.\n\n**Farray's International Dance Center maintains a rating close to 5/5 on Google with hundreds of positive reviews**, establishing itself as a reference for urban dance in Barcelona.",

  "rcbWhatIsP1": "Cuban Reggaeton, also known as Cubatón or Reparto, is the authentic reggaeton that was born and evolved in the streets of Cuba.",
  "rcbWhatIsP2": "Unlike the commercial reggaeton you see in music videos, Cuban reggaeton is characterized by improvisation, extreme body dissociation, and a rawer, street style. It's not just following a choreography: it's feeling the music and letting your body respond.",
  "rcbWhatIsP3": "\"In Cuba, we don\\'t dance to impress. We dance to feel. And that\\'s what we teach here.\"",
  "rcbWhatIsP4": "You'll learn to dissociate every part of your body, improvise with the music, and develop your own style. Because Cuban reggaeton isn't copied: it's lived.",

  "rcbWhatIsQuestionAnswer": "Then this is for you.",
  "rcbCulturalHistoryTitle": "History and Origins of Cuban Reggaeton",
  "rcbCulturalShort": "Cuban reggaeton has its roots in the neighborhoods of Havana, where the fusion of Jamaican reggae with Afro-Cuban rhythms created a unique street style.",
  "rcbCulturalFull": "### Origins: The Neighborhoods of Havana (1990s-2000s)\n\n**Cuban Reggaeton (also known as Cubatón or Reparto) emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s in working-class neighborhoods of Havana like La Lisa, Marianao, Centro Habana and El Cerro.** It was born from the fusion of Puerto Rican reggaeton arriving by radio with traditional Afro-Cuban rhythms: rumba, Cuban son and Yoruba elements.\n\n**\"Cuban Reggaeton fuses Puerto Rican reggaeton with rumba, son and Yoruba rhythms, creating a unique style born in the neighborhoods of Havana.\"**\n\n### Pioneer Artists\n\n**Artists like Candyman, El Taiger, Chocolate MC, Osmani García and El Chacal popularized the genre** and defined its characteristic sound: dembow bases combined with Afro-Cuban percussion, street lyrics and a rebellious attitude reflecting everyday life in Cuban neighborhoods.\n\n### Reparto: The Neighborhood Style\n\n**The term \"Reparto\" comes from the \"repartos\" or working-class neighborhoods of Havana where this style was born.** It's characterized by rawer rhythms than commercial reggaeton, with a more direct and visceral connection to the music. Reparto dancers are recognized worldwide for their improvisation skills and technical mastery.\n\n**\"Reparto is characterized by raw rhythms, street lyrics and a rebellious attitude reflecting life in Cuban neighborhoods.\"**\n\n### Distinctive Dance Techniques\n\nCuban Reggaeton dance is distinguished by unique technical elements:\n- **Constant improvisation**: instant response to music changes\n- **Advanced body dissociation**: hips, chest and shoulders moving independently\n- **Tembleque**: rapid controlled hip vibration, exclusive Cuban technique\n- **Floor movements**: inspired by Afro-Cuban rumba (guaguancó, columbia)\n- **Cuban perreo**: more technical and rhythmic variant than Puerto Rican\n\n**\"Cuban Reggaeton dance is distinguished by improvisation, body dissociation, tembleque and floor movements inspired by Afro-Cuban rumba.\"**\n\n### Afro-Cuban Influences\n\n**Cuban Reggaeton incorporates elements of rumba (guaguancó, columbia), Cuban son and Yoruba dances, creating a unique style that differentiates it from Puerto Rican reggaeton.** This fusion of African and Caribbean traditions gives it its characteristic flavor and richness of movements.\n\n### Cubatón Today: International Expansion\n\nToday, Cubatón has expanded internationally while maintaining its essence: improvisation, flavor and that unique energy that only comes from Cuba. Artists like **El Taiger, Jacob Forever and Chocolate MC** have taken the Cuban sound worldwide, and with it, their way of dancing.\n\n### Health Benefits\n\n**A Cuban Reggaeton class can burn between 350 and 550 calories per hour** due to the intensity of tembleque and body dissociation movements. It also improves coordination, hip flexibility and rhythmic connection.\n\n### Cuban Reggaeton at Farray's Center\n\n**Farray's International Dance Center teaches authentic Cuban Reggaeton with Cuban teachers trained at the National School of Art (ENA) in Havana.** Classes maintain the street essence of the style while offering structured technical progression for all levels.",

  "femCulturalShort": "Femmology is a unique discipline created by Yunaisy Farray in Barcelona, blending heels dancing, dance therapy and feminine expression. Internationally recognised by CID-UNESCO, it has become a global reference for female empowerment through movement.",
  "femCulturalFull": "### Origin and History of Femmology\n\nFemmology was born in Barcelona from the vision of Yunaisy Farray, a Cuban professional dancer trained at the prestigious National School of Art of Cuba (ENA). Following an international career that includes her role as an actress in the film Street Dance 2 (2012), Yunaisy developed this unique methodology that transcends the traditional concept of heels dancing.\n\nThe discipline emerges from the integration of three fields: professional dance technique, dance therapy principles, and the study of feminine body expression. This innovative fusion has positioned Femmology as an internationally recognised practice, with Farray's International Dance Center being an official member of the International Dance Council (CID-UNESCO).\n\n### Methodology and Foundations\n\nThe term \"Femmology\" combines \"femme\" (woman in French) with the suffix \"-ology\" (the study of), literally defining \"the study of femininity\". The methodology is structured around three fundamental pillars:\n\n- **Body technique**: Development of posture, dissociation, muscular control and coordination specific to movement in heels.\n- **Emotional expression**: Application of dance therapy principles to release physical blockages and reconnect with emotions through conscious movement.\n- **Personal empowerment**: Cultivation of confidence, stage presence and self-esteem through progressive body mastery.\n\n### Femmology in Barcelona: World Headquarters\n\nBarcelona has established itself as the world centre of Femmology. In the heart of Eixample, Farray's International Dance Center offers the only official programme of this discipline, where Yunaisy Farray personally directs the training. Students from across Europe travel to Barcelona to train in this exclusive methodology.\n\nThe philosophy of Femmology is distinguished by its focus on internal empowerment: it's not about \"dancing for others\", but about \"feeling powerful for oneself\". Each session creates a safe space where women explore their femininity without judgement, developing elegance and sensuality from a place of self-respect.\n\nOver more than a decade, Femmology has transformed the lives of thousands of women, establishing itself as a pioneering discipline in Barcelona and an international reference in the field of therapeutic dance and female empowerment.",

  "sexystyleCulturalShort": "Sexy Style can be described as a branch of commercial dance in music videos and pop stages, born from the fusion of hip hop/new style, jazz-funk, burlesque and the heels work typical of \"heels dance\".",
  "sexystyleCulturalFull": "### Origins of Sexy Style (Commercial Dance Evolution)\n\n**Sexy Style emerges as a natural evolution of commercial dance, fusing the musicality and attitude of hip hop/new style with the glamour of cabaret, musicals, and burlesque.** From these stage contexts, it moves to academies, where it transforms into its own discipline working on steps, transitions, and poses designed for both stage and music videos, always from a strong and confident feminine energy.\n\n**\"Sexy Style: fusion of hip hop + cabaret + burlesque; stage discipline with strong and confident feminine energy.\"**\n\n### Internal Connection: More than Seduction\n\n**Sexy Style is not a dance of outward seduction, but a practice of internal connection that uses sensuality as a path to inhabit the body with more presence.** Through the work of isolations, body lines, use of hips, torso, and gaze, Sexy Style invites you to feel like the protagonist, without needing to fit into a specific physical stereotype.\n\n**\"Sexy Style = internal connection + body presence; isolations, lines, hips, torso and gaze to feel like the protagonist.\"**\n\n### The Female Empowerment Revolution\n\n**In recent years, Sexy Style has experienced a boom thanks to artists like Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Doja Cat, and a whole generation of women who have claimed their right to express their sensuality without being sexualized or judged.** Current classes translate that imagery from music videos and tours into a safe space to work on self-esteem, stage attitude, and personal confidence, using the body as a tool for liberation and not as an object.\n\n**\"Sexy Style (2020s): female empowerment boom; Beyoncé, Rihanna, Doja Cat; the body as a tool for liberation.\"**\n\n### From Show Dance to Everyday Empowerment\n\n**This movement has turned what was once just \"show dancing\" into a path for everyday empowerment.** Many students use Sexy Style to reconcile with their body, improve their posture, and discover a way of moving that feels authentic and their own. Commercial technique and emotional expression intertwine to build a stronger identity on and off the dance floor.\n\n**\"Sexy Style transforms: from show dance to everyday empowerment; body reconciliation + posture + authentic movement.\"**\n\n### Sexy Style Technique: Heels, Isolations and Attitude\n\n**Sexy Style works a unique combination of technical and expressive skills.** The fundamental elements include:\n\n- **Heels work**: balance, walking, turns and transitions\n- **Isolations**: independent control of hips, torso, shoulders and head\n- **Musicality**: interpretation of nuances, pauses and accents\n- **Stage attitude**: presence, gaze and confidence projection\n\n**\"Sexy Style technique: heels + isolations + musicality + attitude; unique combination of physical and expressive skills.\"**\n\n### Sexy Style in Barcelona: Farray's Center\n\n**Farray's Center was one of the first academies in Barcelona to offer Sexy Style classes with a professional methodology, integrating commercial roots (music videos, tours, heels work) with the personal empowerment approach.** Under the direction of Yasmina Fernández, a program has been developed that combines technique (balance, walking in heels, isolations, musicality) with attitude and stage presence work.\n\n**\"Farray's Center Barcelona: pioneers in professional Sexy Style; methodology integrating commercial technique + personal empowerment.\"**\n\n### Benefits of Sexy Style\n\n**Practicing Sexy Style develops multiple physical and emotional capabilities that transcend dance.** It improves body posture, strengthens stabilizing muscles (especially core and legs), increases coordination and proprioception. On an emotional level, it reinforces self-esteem, reduces social anxiety, and develops a more positive relationship with one's own body.\n\n**\"Sexy Style develops: posture + core + coordination + self-esteem + body confidence; comprehensive physical and emotional transformation.\"**\n\n### A Safe Space for All\n\n**Today, Sexy Style at Farray's is experienced as a space for technical learning and a self-confidence laboratory where each student can build their own version of what it means to be sensual, strong, and free.** There are no perfect bodies or age limits: just women who decide to reconnect with their personal power through movement.\n\n**\"Farray's Center: safe space for all; no perfect bodies or age limits; reconnection with personal power.\"**",

  "sxrCulturalShort": "Reggaeton was born in the 90s between Panama and Puerto Rico, emerging from the mix of Jamaican reggae, American hip hop and Caribbean Latin rhythms.",
  "sxrCulturalFull": "### Origin of Reggaeton\n\nReggaeton emerged in Panama in the late 1980s with \"reggae en español\", popularized by artists like El General. In the 1990s, Puerto Rico adopted and transformed the genre, where producers like DJ Playero and DJ Nelson created the characteristic \"dembow\" rhythm that defines modern reggaeton.\n\nThe term \"reggaeton\" was consolidated in Puerto Rico around 1994-1995. Daddy Yankee, Tego Calderón and Don Omar were pioneers who took the genre from underground to international fame in the 2000s.\n\n### Evolution to Sexy Reggaeton\n\nSexy Reggaeton is a specialization of classic Puerto Rican perreo, focused on feminine technique and expression. It combines elements of reggaeton, Jamaican dancehall and American twerk, developing movements such as body rolls, body isolation and controlled drops.\n\n### Fundamental techniques\n\n- **Body roll**: fluid wave of the torso from chest to hips.\n- **Perreo**: circular and descending hip movements characteristic of the genre.\n- **Body isolation**: independent control of hips, torso and limbs.\n- **Drops**: controlled floor drops requiring strength and coordination.\n\n### Reggaeton in Spain\n\nSpain was one of the first European countries to adopt reggaeton. In Barcelona, the Latin urban scene grew significantly since 2005, driven by the Latin American community and local artists.\n\nRosalía, born in Sant Esteve Sesrovires (Barcelona), fused reggaeton with flamenco in hits like \"Malamente\" (2018) and \"Con Altura\" (2019), gaining international recognition and two Latin Grammy Awards.\n\n### Reference artists\n\nDaddy Yankee (Puerto Rico), Bad Bunny (Puerto Rico), Karol G (Colombia), J Balvin (Colombia), Anitta (Brazil) and Rosalía (Spain) have defined the current reggaeton aesthetic, with choreographies celebrating sensual movement and empowerment.",

  "modernjazzCulturalShort": "Modern Jazz is born from the fusion of classical ballet with American jazz and modern dance, creating a unique style that combines academic technique with free expression.",
  "modernjazzCulturalFull": "### Origins of Modern Jazz\n\nModern Jazz emerged in the United States during the 20th century, when dancers and choreographers began fusing classical ballet technique with the rhythmic energy of jazz and the expressiveness of modern dance. Pioneers like Jack Cole, Matt Mattox and Luigi developed the foundations of what we know today as Modern Jazz.\n\nThis dance takes from ballet the posture, clean lines, turns and jumps; from jazz, the musicality, groove and attitude; and from modern dance, the freedom of movement, floor work and emotional expression.\n\n### The evolution of the style\n\nModern Jazz has constantly evolved, incorporating influences from hip hop, contemporary dance and commercial styles. Choreographers like Bob Fosse revolutionized the genre with his characteristic style of isolations, angular movements and contained sensuality.\n\nToday, Modern Jazz is characterized by its versatility: from lyrical and emotional pieces to energetic and dynamic choreographies. It's the style you see in Broadway musicals, dance movies and the most acclaimed shows in the world.\n\n### Modern Jazz in Barcelona\n\nFarray's Center offers Modern Jazz classes under the direction of Alejandro Miñoso, a teacher with classical and contemporary training who combines technical demands with a friendly and motivating environment. Classes work on base technique, musicality, body expression and interpretation, preparing students for both the stage and enjoying dance.\n\n### Scientific Benefits of Dancing Modern Jazz\n\nScientific studies show that dancing (like Modern Jazz) improves coordination, flexibility and significantly reduces stress, being as effective for body and mind as many gym workouts.\n\n**One hour of intense dance can burn between 300 and 800 calories**, similar to running at a moderate pace, but with music, expression and much more fun.\n\nA famous study published in the **New England Journal of Medicine** showed that people who danced frequently had up to **76% lower risk of developing dementia**.\n\nFarray's International Dance Center is rated close to **5/5 on Google**, with hundreds of reviews placing it among the best-rated dance centers in Barcelona.",

  "balletWhatIsP1": "Classical ballet is more than a dance style; it is a discipline that strengthens your body and mind, and improves your overall well-being. Beyond training professional dancers, ballet offers accessible benefits for everyone, from improving posture and balance to enhancing concentration and memory.",
  "balletWhatIsP2": "Since the late 17th century, Pierre Beauchamp established the five basic foot positions that still constitute the universal language of ballet today. Although born in Italy, it was in France where this technique took its definitive form, which is why we use terms like plié, tendu and jeté to name its most recognized movements.",
  "balletWhatIsP3": "At Farray's, we fuse classical technique with the explosive power of the Cuban ballet school, which trained Carlos Acosta –considered for decades one of the best dancers in the world, compared to Nureyev and Baryshnikov for his aerial virtuosity–. This unique methodology brings athletic strength, expressiveness and musicality that enhance any dance, from hip hop and afrobeat to flamenco or contemporary dance, making ballet the essential technical foundation for complete dancers.",
  "balletWhatIsP4": "Practicing ballet improves motor coordination, flexibility, muscular strength, balance and body awareness, facilitating the technical development of any dancer and promoting a healthy and disciplined lifestyle for those who simply seek well-being and bodily expression.",
  "balletWhatIsP5": "Our training program, endorsed by CID-UNESCO, integrates this complete methodology so that each student, professional or amateur, gets the most out of their body and mind, achieving a transformation that goes far beyond the art of dance.",
  "balletWhatIsQuestionTitle": "Do you think it is too late for you?",
  "balletWhatIsQuestionAnswer": "It never is.",
  "balletCulturalHistoryTitle": "Want to learn more about ballet?",
  "balletCulturalShort": "Ballet was born in the Italian Renaissance courts and perfected in France under Louis XIV, who founded the first formal school dedicated to professional dance in 1661. This discipline has withstood wars, revolutions and social changes because it offers something unique: the complete transformation of the human being through movement.",
  "balletCulturalFull": "### Definition of Classical Ballet\n\n**Classical ballet is a highly technical form of theatrical dance with French vocabulary based on fundamental principles such as turnout (external rotation of legs), the five positions codified by Pierre Beauchamp in 1700, and pointe work.** It is the foundation of almost all dance disciplines and requires years of systematic training.\n\n**\"Classical Ballet: technical theatrical dance, French vocabulary, turnout, 5 positions (Beauchamp, 1700), pointe work.\"**\n\n### Origins of Ballet: From Courts to Stage\n\n**Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts (15th century), was codified in France under Louis XIV who founded the Académie Royale de Danse in 1661, and reached its technical peak in Russia with Marius Petipa and Tchaikovsky's ballets** (Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, The Nutcracker).\n\nWhen Catherine de Medici married Henry II of France, she brought this tradition to the French court, marking the beginning of a new cultural era in Europe.\n\n**\"Ballet (1661, Louis XIV): Académie Royale de Danse. Peak in Russia: Petipa + Tchaikovsky.\"**\n\n### The French Golden Age\n\nIn 1661, Louis XIV—known as \"the Sun King\" for his leading role in the Ballet de la Nuit—founded the Académie Royale de Danse, the first institution to formally codify and teach dance. His master, **Pierre Beauchamp, established the five fundamental foot positions** that remain the universal technical foundation of classical ballet.\n\n### Fundamental Ballet Techniques\n\n**Fundamental ballet techniques include: barre work (pliés, tendus, dégagés, battements), center work (adagio, pirouettes, allegro), jumps (petit allegro, grand allegro), and pointe work for advanced level.** The technique requires muscular control, flexibility and millimetric precision.\n\nWhy has ballet endured for over 300 years? Because it develops:\n\n- **Perfect body alignment**: every movement starts from a strong, balanced center\n- **Spatial awareness**: exact knowledge of every part of the body in space\n- **Deep muscle control**: strength from stabilizing muscles\n- **Grace under pressure**: the ability to make the difficult look easy\n\n**\"Ballet technique: barre + center + allegro + pointe. Requires control, flexibility, precision.\"**\n\n### The Cuban School of Ballet at Farray's\n\n**The Cuban School of Ballet, founded by Alicia Alonso in 1948, is distinguished by its technical virtuosity, dramatic expressiveness and adaptation of classical technique to the Latin physique.** Cuban dancers like Carlos Acosta, Lorena Feijóo and José Manuel Carreño have shone in the world's leading companies.\n\n**At Farray's Center, ballet classes follow the tradition of the Cuban School of Ballet**, world-renowned for combining Russian technique with Latin expressiveness. **Alejandro Miñoso, trained at ENA (Cuba's National School of Art) and former soloist with Carlos Acosta's company**, transmits this unique methodology.\n\n**\"Cuban School (Alicia Alonso, 1948): Russian technique + Latin expressiveness. At Farray's: ENA-Cuba methodology.\"**\n\n### Scientific Benefits of Ballet\n\nStudies published in journals like *Journal of Dance Medicine & Science* show that **a ballet class burns between 300 and 400 calories and tones all muscle groups**, especially core, legs and glutes. Additionally, ballet:\n\n- Improves bone density and helps prevent osteoporosis\n- Increases flexibility and joint range of motion\n- Develops proprioception and body awareness\n- Reduces stress and anxiety\n- Improves posture and relieves back pain\n\n**\"Ballet: 300-400 calories/class. Journal of Dance Medicine & Science: improves bone density.\"**\n\n### Ballet Today: For Everyone Without Distinction\n\nThe stigma that \"ballet is for girls\" has become obsolete. Male dancers like Roberto Bolle, Sergei Polunin and Carlos Acosta have shown that ballet requires extraordinary strength and athleticism. At Farray's, men and women of all ages discover that ballet is the best training for any dance style.\n\n**Ballet's legacy lives on in every dancer who learns the five positions, in every Nutcracker production at Christmas, and in the technical foundation of virtually all modern dance styles.** It is UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage and continues evolving in the 21st century.\n\n### Ballet Vocabulary\n\nAll ballet terms are in French, a legacy of its development at the court of Versailles:\n\n- **Plié**: bending the knees while keeping the back straight\n- **Tendu**: stretching the leg while keeping the toe on the floor\n- **Jeté**: jump from one leg to another\n- **Pirouette**: turn on one leg\n- **Arabesque**: position with one leg extended behind",

  "balletFaqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions about our Ballet classes in Barcelona",
  "balletFaqQ1": "What exactly is classical ballet?",
  "balletFaqA1": "Classical ballet is a form of stage dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts and developed in France. It is characterized by its codified technique (the 5 foot positions created by Beauchamp), elegant and precise movements, and French vocabulary. It is the technical basis of all other dance forms.",
  "balletFaqQ2": "Can I start ballet as an adult with no prior experience?",
  "balletFaqA2": "Absolutely. At Farray's we have specific classes for adult beginners. You don't need prior flexibility or any dance experience. Our teachers specialize in teaching adults who start from scratch.",
  "balletFaqQ3": "What clothes and footwear do I need for ballet classes?",
  "balletFaqA3": "To start, fitted clothing that allows your posture to be seen (tights, fitted leggings) and ballet slippers (the classic ones). For your first class you can come with socks and fitted comfortable clothes. We will guide you on the appropriate equipment.",
  "balletFaqQ4": "Is ballet good physical exercise?",
  "balletFaqA4": "Excellent. Ballet works all muscle groups, especially core stabilizers and deep muscles. It improves flexibility, strength, balance and coordination. One class burns approximately 300-400 calories and tones without creating muscle bulk.",
  "balletFaqQ5": "What is the difference between classical and neoclassical ballet?",
  "balletFaqA5": "Classical ballet follows traditional rules established in the 17th-19th centuries (codified positions, tutu, pointe, narrative). Neoclassical, developed in the 20th century by choreographers like Balanchine, maintains classical technique but with greater freedom of movement, simpler costumes and more abstract choreography.",
  "balletFaqQ6": "What is the difference between Classical Ballet and Lyrical Contemporary?",
  "balletFaqA6": "Classical ballet is based on a codified technique with precise positions and movements, pointe work, turnout and a formal aesthetic. Lyrical contemporary combines that technical foundation with greater expressive freedom, fluid movements, floor work and emotional connection to the music. At our academy we offer both styles so you can explore whichever one connects best with you.",
  "balletFaqQ7": "Who are the ballet teachers at Farray's?",
  "balletFaqA7": "Daniel Sene teaches Intermediate Ballet on Mondays at 8pm. Alejandro Miñoso, Cuban teacher trained at the ENA and former Carlos Acosta soloist, teaches Beginner Ballet on Thursdays at 11am. Both combine technical rigor with an accessible approach for adults.",
  "balletFaqQ8": "Can I try a Ballet class before enrolling?",
  "balletFaqA8": "Depending on the season, the welcome class for residents has a special welcome price. For tourists, it is paid. If you like it and decide to stay, the amount is deducted from your first payment.",
  "balletFaqQ9": "What ballet levels do you have?",
  "balletFaqA9": "We currently offer two levels: Beginners (Thursdays 11am with Alejandro) for those starting from zero or with little experience, and Intermediate (Mondays 8pm with Daniel) for those who already master basic positions and fundamental barre exercises.",
  "balletFaqQ10": "What if I miss a class due to work or commitments?",
  "balletFaqA10": "If you have a membership and cancel a class, you have 30 days to make it up. Everything is managed from our app, conveniently and without complications.",
  "balletFaqQ11": "What kind of music is used in ballet classes?",
  "balletFaqA11": "Mainly classical music: Tchaikovsky, Chopin, Delibes, Minkus... The great composers of the ballet repertoire. The music is specifically designed for each exercise: adagio for slow movements, allegro for jumps, etc.",
  "balletFaqQ12": "Can I sign up at any time of year?",
  "balletFaqA12": "Yes, enrollment is open all year. There is no \"course\" with a fixed start date. You can join whenever you want and follow the class pace.",
  "balletFaqQ13": "Do you organize performances or galas?",
  "balletFaqA13": "Yes, we hold an annual gala at one of the most important theaters in Barcelona where all students who wish can participate. It is voluntary but highly recommended: performing on a real stage is part of the dancer experience.",
  "balletFaqQ14": "Do you have any special discounts?",
  "balletFaqA14": "Yes. We offer discounts if you sign up for more than one course. Check the website or ask us directly for more details.",
  "balletFaqQ15": "Where is the academy located?",
  "balletFaqA15": "We are located at Calle Entença 100, Barcelona (08015), between Plaza España and Sants. You can call us at <a href=\"tel:+34622247085\">+34 622 247 085</a>, email us at <a href=\"mailto:info@farrayscenter.com\">info@farrayscenter.com</a> or check all the information at <a href=\"https://www.farrayscenter.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.farrayscenter.com</a>.",
  "balletFaqQ16": "Do I need a lot of flexibility to do ballet?",
  "balletFaqA16": "You don't need prior flexibility. Flexibility develops progressively with practice. The important thing is to start; elasticity will come with time and consistency. Our teachers adapt exercises to each body.",
  "balletFaqQ17": "What do you achieve in our Ballet classes in Barcelona?",
  "balletFaqA17": "Improve your dance technique with our Ballet classes. Acquire body awareness, notions of space and movement dynamics. Improve your motor coordination, memory, balance, posture and increase the tone and extension of your muscles. Transform your body and stay fit thanks to the demanding physical work this discipline requires.",
  "balletFaqQ18": "How does the Ballet course work and who is it designed for?",
  "balletFaqA18": "Our ballet classes offer specific technique training and body awareness, plus flexibility work. Classical dance contributes to developing habits of discipline, stimulating love for study and correct use of movement. The methodology challenges physical conditioning with multiple movements, working all muscle groups harmoniously.",

  "balletCitableFact3": "Farray's International Dance Center is a CID-UNESCO academy with over 500 five-star Google reviews.",
  "balletCitableDefinicion": "**\"Classical ballet is a highly technical form of theatrical dance with French vocabulary based on fundamental principles such as turnout (external rotation of legs), the five positions codified by Pierre Beauchamp in 1700, and pointe work. It is the foundation of almost all dance disciplines and requires years of systematic training.\"**",
  "balletCitableOrigen": "**\"Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts (15th century), was codified in France under Louis XIV who founded the Académie Royale de Danse in 1661, and reached its technical peak in Russia with Marius Petipa and Tchaikovsky\\'s ballets (Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, The Nutcracker).\"**",
  "balletCitableTecnicas": "**\"Fundamental ballet techniques include: barre work (pliés, tendus, dégagés, battements), center work (adagio, pirouettes, allegro), jumps (petit allegro, grand allegro), and pointe work for advanced level. The technique requires muscular control, flexibility and millimetric precision.\"**",
  "balletCitableMetodologia": "**\\\"At Farray's Center, ballet classes follow the tradition of the Cuban School of Ballet, world-renowned for combining Russian technique with Latin expressiveness. Alejandro Miñoso, trained at ENA (Cuba's National School of Art) and former soloist with Carlos Acosta's company, transmits this unique methodology.\\\"**",
  "balletCitableEvolucionGlobal": "**\"Ballet evolved from courtly entertainment to professional theatrical art. The great schools (French, Italian, Russian, Danish, English, Cuban) developed specific methods. Today, companies like the Bolshoi, Royal Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet and Cuban National Ballet keep the tradition alive while incorporating contemporary works.\"**",
  "balletCitableExpresionCorporal": "**\"Ballet develops exceptional body awareness: upright posture, spinal elongation, precise arm placement (port de bras), clean lines and grace in every movement. This discipline transforms the way you walk, sit and move in everyday life.\"**",
  "balletCitableEscuelaCubana": "**\"The Cuban School of Ballet, founded by Alicia Alonso in 1948, is distinguished by its technical virtuosity, dramatic expressiveness and adaptation of classical technique to the Latin physique.

  "balletCitableLegado": "**\"Ballet\\'s legacy lives on in every dancer who learns the five positions, in every Nutcracker production at Christmas, and in the technical foundation of virtually all modern dance styles.

It's not simply a mix of styles: it's a proprietary methodology developed over 15 years that you'll only find at Farray's Dance Center Barcelona.",
  "afrojazzCulturalFull": "### The Creation of Afro Jazz\n\nAfro Jazz did not exist as a concept before Yunaisy Farray developed it. It is a unique technical fusion that honors African roots while incorporating Jazz dance precision.\n\n**Yunaisy Farray**, trained at the prestigious **National School of Art of Cuba (ENA)**, dedicated over 15 years to developing this unique fusion. The result is the **Farray Method®**, a methodology that integrates codified African technique, Jazz vocabulary with lines and spatial projection, and a unique rhythmic connection that translates African polyrhythms with Jazz musicality.\n\n**\"Afro Jazz (Farray Method®): ENA Cuba + Jazz dance fusion, 15+ years of methodological development, only CID-UNESCO worldwide training.\"**\n\n### Technical Fusion\n\nUnlike other styles, Afro Jazz works extreme dynamic contrasts: from earth to air, from contraction to expansion, from rhythm to silence. The **Farray Method®** structures each class with progressive technical warm-up (15 min), diagonal exercises for traveling and projection, mirror work for choreography and repertoire, and cool-down with specific stretches.\n\n**\"Afro Jazz class structure: technical warm-up + diagonal (projection) + mirror (choreography) + cool-down. Systematized methodology.\"**\n\n### International Recognition\n\nFarray's Dance Center is the only academy in the world teaching Afro Jazz with its creator's original methodology, endorsed by **CID-UNESCO (International Dance Council)**. Internationally endorsed center since 2017, with over 15 years of methodological development and +15,000 students trained in Barcelona.\n\n**\"Farray's Center: only CID-UNESCO world center for Afro Jazz. Verifiable credential since 2017.\"**\n\n### Why the Farray Method® is Different\n\nWhat makes Yunaisy Farray's Afro Jazz unique: systematized and progressive methodology (vs. improvised), CID-UNESCO international endorsement (vs. no certification), direct training with the concept creator, and ENA Cuba + Jazz technique base (vs. diffuse origin).\n\n**\"Farray Method® vs other fusions: systematized, CID-UNESCO endorsed, direct creator, ENA+Jazz base.\"**\n\n### Documented Physical Benefits\n\nA 60-minute Afro Jazz class burns 400-600 calories per session, works 85% of muscle groups, measurably improves bilateral coordination, and develops flexibility and strength simultaneously.\n\n**\"Afro Jazz physical: 400-600 kcal/hour, 85% muscle groups, bilateral coordination + flexibility/strength.\"**\n\n### Afro Jazz Today\n\nDancers from around the world travel to Barcelona specifically to train in Afro Jazz with Yunaisy Farray. It's a technical pilgrimage for those seeking the original source. Afro Jazz has become a reference discipline for dancers seeking technical versatility between African and contemporary styles, training with the concept creator, internationally recognized certification, and exclusive repertoire that exists nowhere else.\n\n**\"Afro Jazz Barcelona: world destination for original training.

  "contemporaneoCulturalShort": "Learn Contemporary Dance with **specialist teachers trained in the Cuban dance school (ENA and ENBC)**. Martha Graham, José Limón and Merce Cunningham techniques fused with Cuban expressiveness and conservatory methodology.",
  "contemporaneoCulturalFull": "### The Origins: American Modern Dance (1900–1950)\n\nContemporary dance has its roots in American modern dance from the early 20th century. Pioneers like **Isadora Duncan (1877–1927)** rejected the pointe shoes and corsets of classical ballet, seeking natural movement connected to the earth. **Ruth St. Denis** and **Ted Shawn** founded the **Denishawn School in 1915**, which became the seedbed for the next generation.\n\n**\"American modern dance (1900–1950): Duncan, St. Denis, Shawn (Denishawn 1915) → breaking from classical ballet, natural earth-body movement.\"**\n\n### The Great Techniques: Graham, Limón, Cunningham\n\n**Martha Graham (1894–1991)** developed **contraction-release** (emotional torso center), the fundamental basis of contemporary training.\n\n**José Limón (1908–1972)** contributed **fall and recovery**, working with gravity for fluidity and musicality.\n\n**Merce Cunningham (1919–2009)** separated dance from music/narrative, introducing compositional chance and torso-limb independence.\n\n**\"Contemporary base techniques: Graham (contraction-release), Limón (fall-recovery), Cunningham (chance composition/abstraction).\"**\n\n### Lyrical Contemporary: Technique and Emotion\n\n**Lyrical contemporary** fuses modern technique with emotional/musical connection, maintaining narrative and expressiveness. Wide lines, fluidity and deep music-movement relationship distinguish it from pure abstraction.\n\n**\"Lyrical contemporary: modern technique + emotional narrative + musicality. Demanded style for technique-expression balance.\"**\n\n### Floorwork\n\n**Floorwork** distinguishes contemporary dance: **release technique** (letting go of tensions), **contact improvisation** (1970s) and fluid floor movement allow slides, rolls and organic transitions. The floor is an ally, not a limit.\n\n**\"Floorwork: release + contact improvisation. Floor as creative/technical ally in contemporary.\"**\n\n### The Cuban School of Contemporary Dance\n\nCuba created from 1959 its **own school** (Ramiro Guerra), integrating American modern, classical and Afro-Cuban folklore. **ENA and ENBC** train with conservatory methodology: classical barre, modern, center, folklore, stage creation. Result: versatile, powerful, musical dancers.\n\n**\"ENA/ENBC Cuba: integral training (classical + modern + folk). Globally recognized conservatory methodology.\"**\n\n### Contemporary at Farray's Center\n\n**Specialist teachers trained in the Cuban school (ENA/ENBC)**, with solid technical base in ballet and contemporary. Integral training combining classical, modern and folk for professional results.\n\nModalities:\n- **Basic Lyrical Contemporary**: fundamentals for beginners, musicality, expression.\n- **Intermediate/Advanced Lyrical Contemporary**: complex phrasing, advanced stage work.\n- **Floor & Flow**: release, transitions, contemporary dynamism.\n\n**\"Farray's: contemporary with Cuban school specialists (ENA/ENBC). Basic-advanced lyrical + floor/flow/release.\"**\n\n### Physical and Cognitive Benefits\n\nWorks comprehensively: **flexibility, functional strength, coordination, proprioception, muscle memory**. Floorwork strengthens core/joint mobility. Improvisation drives creativity/concentration/mind-body.\n\n**300-500 calories/hour** depending on intensity, plus emotional wellbeing and stress relief.\n\n**\"Farray's Contemporary (ENA/ENBC specialists): 300-500 cal/hour, flexibility/strength/coordination. CID-UNESCO plan, 5/5 Google (500+ reviews).\"**",

It is characterized by floorwork, improvisation, emotional connection with music and the development of one\\'s own body language.\"**",
  "contemporaneoCitableOrigen": "**\"Contemporary dance has its roots in American modern dance from the early 20th century. Pioneers like Isadora Duncan (1877–1927) rejected the pointe shoes of classical ballet seeking natural movement. Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn founded the Denishawn School in 1915, seedbed for the next generation of choreographers.\"**",
  "contemporaneoCitableTecnicas": "**\"The fundamental techniques of contemporary include: contraction-release (Graham), fall and recovery (Limón), release technique, contact improvisation (1970s), floorwork and floor work.

  "afrocontemporaneoCulturalFull": "### The Farray Method®: DCC Adapted for Adults Outside Cuba\n\n**The Farray Method® is an exclusive pedagogical system created by Yunaisy Farray to teach Afro Contemporary more solidly and effectively to adults outside Cuba.** Yunaisy, a Cuban trained at the National School of Art of Cuba (ENA), detected that the original Cuban methodology—designed for bodies that grow up dancing from childhood—needed to be adapted for adults outside Cuba, where students arrive with different bodily and cultural backgrounds.\n\n**\"Farray Method® (Barcelona): DCC/ENA pedagogy adapted for adults outside Cuba; structured progression for faster and more solid results than traditional methodology.\"**\n\n### The Origins: Contemporary Dance of Cuba (DCC, 1959)\n\n**Afro Contemporary is the pedagogical name for Contemporary Dance of Cuba (DCC), founded by Ramiro Guerra in 1959.** This revolutionary discipline fuses **Martha Graham** techniques with Afro-Cuban roots (Yoruba rumba), and was officially systematized at the **ENA (National School of Art) in 1962**. The first generation of teachers includes figures such as **Méndez and Collazo (1959)**.\n\n**\"Afro Contemporary / DCC (1959, Ramiro Guerra): Graham + Afro-Cuban polyrhythm, ENA 1962.\"**\n\n### Technical Fusion\n\nWhat makes Afro Contemporary unique is its ability to integrate seemingly opposite elements:\n\n- **Modern technique**: Contraction-release (Graham), fluidity (Limón), spatiality (Cunningham)\n- **Cuban folklore**: Rumba undulations, energy of the Yoruba Orishas, Afro-Caribbean polyrhythm\n- **Body expression**: Deep movement-music connection that goes beyond pure technique\n\n**\"DCC = Graham/Limón/Cunningham fusion + Yoruba rumba; hybrid technique requiring mastery of both worlds.\"**\n\n### Music: Afro-Cuban Polyrhythm\n\n**Afro Contemporary is practiced to music that fuses Afro-Cuban rhythms (batá, rumba, son) with contemporary compositions.** The characteristic polyrhythm requires the dancer to develop complex musicality and an interpretive capacity that goes beyond simple counting.\n\n**\"Afro-Cuban polyrhythm (batá, rumba, son) fused with contemporary music; rhythmic complexity develops advanced musicality.\"**\n\n### Why the Farray Method® Works Better in Europe\n\n**Yunaisy Farray adapted her ENA training for the European context**, creating a pedagogical progression that:\n\n- **Builds the foundation from scratch**: Does not assume the student has years of prior training\n- **Works body dissociation progressively**: Specific exercises for bodies that did not grow up with polyrhythm\n- **Integrates technical explanation with practice**: More analytical methodology than traditional Cuban, adapted to European learning\n\n**\"Farray Method® (Yunaisy Farray, ENA Cuba → Barcelona): pedagogical progression specifically designed for European dancers; faster results than traditional ENA methodology.\"**\n\n### International Recognition CID-UNESCO\n\nThe Afro Contemporary taught at **Farray's International Dance Center** is part of the professional dance training curriculum **endorsed by the CID-UNESCO** (International Dance Council, Paris). This recognition certifies both the authenticity of the DCC technique and the effectiveness of the Farray Method® for its teaching.\n\n**\"Farray's Center: only academy in Barcelona with Afro Contemporary (DCC) CID-UNESCO endorsed + exclusive Farray Method®.\"**\n\n### Living Legacy: 65 Years of DCC\n\n**Contemporary Dance of Cuba (DCC)** has been bringing Afro Contemporary to stages worldwide since the 1970s.

The Farray Method® brings this tradition to Barcelona with optimized pedagogy.\n\n**\"DCC: 65 years exporting Afro-modern Cuban fusion. Farray Method® brings this tradition to Europe with adapted pedagogy.\"**\n\n### Physical and Cognitive Benefits\n\n**Scientific studies on technical dance indicate that disciplines like Afro Contemporary improve complex motor coordination, proprioception, muscle memory, and body dissociation capacity, in addition to cardiovascular and flexibility benefits.**\n\n**An Afro Contemporary class can burn 300-480 calories per hour depending on body weight and intensity, with simultaneous work on strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular endurance.**\n\n**Farray's International Dance Center: Afro Contemporary (DCC) with exclusive Farray Method®, CID-UNESCO endorsement, 5/5 Google rating with over 500 reviews.**",

  "hiphopCulturalFull": "### The Origins: The South Bronx of New York (1973-1974)\n\n**Hip Hop emerged in the South Bronx of New York between 1973 and 1974, when DJ Kool Herc began isolating the \"breaks\" (instrumental sections) from funk and soul records**, creating a new sound that invited dancing. The African American and Latino communities of the Bronx transformed the streets into stages for artistic expression.\n\n**\"Hip Hop dance was born between 1973-1974 in the South Bronx of New York, driven by DJ Kool Herc and developed by African American and Latino communities as a form of artistic expression.\"**\n\n### The Four Foundational Pillars\n\nHip Hop culture is built on **four fundamental pillars**:\n- **DJing** (turntablism): record manipulation and break creation\n- **MCing** (rap): lyrical expression and rhymes\n- **Graffiti**: urban visual art\n- **B-boying/B-girling** (breaking): dance\n\n**\"The elements of hip hop dance — freestyle, battles and ciphers — define the competitive and community essence of this culture.\"**\n\n### Pioneer Groups\n\nGroups that established the technical and stylistic foundations still valid today:\n- **The Rock Steady Crew** (1977): breaking pioneers\n- **The Lockers** (1973): locking creators with Don Campbell\n- **Electric Boogaloos** (1977): popping innovators with Boogaloo Sam\n\n### Main Hip Hop Techniques\n\n**The main techniques include: grooves and bounces (rhythmic base), social dances, toprock, footwork, freezes, power moves, and elements of locking, popping and breaking.** Each style has its own vocabulary and specific history.\n\n### Breaking: Olympic Discipline\n\n**Breaking was included as an Olympic sport at the Paris 2024 Games**, officially recognizing Hip Hop as an elite sports discipline. This historic milestone validates decades of technical and artistic development.\n\n### From the Street to the World: Global Expansion\n\nWith more than **50 years of global development**, Hip Hop has gone from block parties in the Bronx to becoming a planetary cultural phenomenon. **Hip Hop is practiced by more than 30 million people worldwide.**\n\n**\"Hip hop dance is practiced both on the street and in professional academies, always maintaining its spirit of freedom and self-expression.\"**\n\n### Health Benefits\n\n**A 60-minute Hip Hop class can burn between 400-600 calories** while improving coordination, rhythm and body expression. **Studies show that dancing hip hop improves memory, concentration and reduces stress levels.**\n\n### Hip Hop at Farray's Center\n\nAt our academy, Hip Hop is part of the professional dance training curriculum endorsed by **CID-UNESCO (International Dance Council of UNESCO in Paris)**. The methodology respects the roots of the culture: base technique, musicality, movement history and development of personal style through freestyle.\n\n**\"Hip Hop is not just a dance style, it's a life philosophy that promotes creativity, respect and self-improvement.\"**\n\nOur teacher **Marcos Martínez**, judge of international competitions and reference of Hip Hop in Spain, transmits not only technique but the values and history that make this style unique.",

  "salsaCubanaCulturalShort": "Cuban salsa, also known as \"Casino\", was born in Cuba in the 1950s as a fusion of Cuban Son, Mambo and other Afro-Cuban rhythms. Unlike line salsa, Casino is danced in a wheel with circular movements and partner changes.",
  "salsaCubanaCulturalFull": "### Origins: Casino and the Social Clubs of Havana (1950s)\n\n**Cuban salsa, originally known as \"Casino\", emerged in the social clubs of Havana during the 1950s.** The name comes from the Casino Deportivo de La Habana, where young people of that era developed this unique style dancing in \"rueda\" (wheel) and exchanging partners to the rhythm of Cuban son.\n\n**\"Casino was born in the Casino Deportivo de La Habana in the 1950s, fusing Cuban Son, Mambo, Cha-cha-chá and Afro-Cuban rhythms into a style of circular movements and inward turns.\"**\n\n### Distinctive Characteristics of Casino\n\nUnlike line salsa (LA or NY styles), Casino is characterized by:\n- **Circular movements** instead of linear displacement\n- **Inward turns** (opposite to line salsa)\n- **Close connection** with the partner\n- **More relaxed and playful style**\n- **Improvisation** based on communication between dancers\n\n**\"Casino differs from line salsa by its circular movements, inward turns, close connection and more relaxed, playful character.\"**\n\n### Rueda de Casino: Cultural Heritage\n\n**Rueda de Casino is a group form of dancing Cuban salsa declared Cultural Heritage of Cuba.** Multiple couples form a circle and execute synchronized figures under the direction of a \"caller\" or leader, who calls out the names of figures for everyone to execute in unison.\n\nThis collective form of dancing reinforces the sense of community and shared musicality, fundamental elements of Cuban culture.\n\n### The Music: Instrumentation and Rhythms\n\nCuban salsa music incorporates rich instrumentation:\n- **Percussion**: congas, timbales, bongos, güiro, maracas, clave\n- **Rhythm section**: piano, bass\n- **Brass**: trumpets, trombones\n\nThe most danced rhythms include **timba, Cuban son, salsa dura and traditional casino**. The Cuban clave (3-2 or 2-3 rhythmic pattern) is the heart of the salsa rhythm.\n\n### Musicality and Technique\n\n**Musicality in Cuban salsa means dancing on the correct beat (usually on 1 or 3), interpreting breaks, changes and accents in the music, and emotionally expressing the content of each song.**\n\nLeading and following are fundamental skills that allow clear, safe and elegant communication between dancers.\n\n### Global Expansion\n\n**From Cuba, salsa expanded globally from the 1970s, developing different regional styles.** New York developed salsa \"on 2\" (Mambo), Los Angeles salsa \"on 1\", while Casino remained the traditional Cuban style, preserving its circular movements and connection to Afro-Cuban roots.\n\n### Health Benefits\n\n**Fitness studies indicate that dancing salsa burns between 300-400 calories per hour, improves motor coordination, strengthens memory and reduces stress and anxiety levels.** Partner dancing also develops social skills and non-verbal communication.\n\n### The Farray Method®\n\nThe Farray Method® rescues and teaches this authentic tradition with a unique pedagogical approach: **it prioritizes leading, following, musicality and partner connection before teaching complex figures.** This method has trained more than 15,000 students in countries like Finland, Italy, Germany and Spain.\n\n**\"The Farray Method® teaches specific techniques for clear, safe and elegant communication between dancers, respecting the essence of Cuban Casino.\"**",

  "salsaLadyCulturalTitle": "History and Origin of Lady Style",
  "salsaLadyCulturalShort": "Lady Style was born as a natural evolution of salsa dancing, when female dancers began to develop specific techniques to express their femininity within partner dancing.",
  "salsaLadyCulturalFull": "### History and Origins of Lady Style\n\n**Lady Style was born as an evolution of the female role in salsa, arising from dancers' need to express their personality and femininity within partner dancing.** Although its origins are difficult to trace precisely, it developed mainly in Latin dance schools in the United States and the Caribbean during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n**\"Lady Style (also known as 'estilo chica' or 'ladies styling') emerged as an independent discipline when salsa female dancers began developing specific techniques to shine during freestyle and improvisation moments.\"**\n\n### The Female Role in Salsa\n\n**Traditionally, in Cuban salsa and other Latin styles, women adopted a \"follower\" role, responding to the leader's signals.** However, as dance evolved, women began claiming more prominence, developing their own techniques that allowed them to express their personality without depending exclusively on the leader.\n\n**\"Lady Style represents the technical and artistic emancipation of the salsa dancer, allowing her to shine with her own light during improvisation and freestyle moments.\"**\n\n### Cuban Lady Style\n\n**In Cuba, \"estilo chica\" was always an integral part of street dancing.** Cuban female dancers developed a unique way of moving that combines classical ballet technique (inherited from the Soviet-Cuban school) with the flavor, sensuality and flair of Afro-Cuban rhythms. This unique fusion distinguishes Cuban Lady Style and is the foundation of the Farray Method®.\n\n**\"Cuban Lady Style fuses classical ballet technique with Afro-Cuban sensuality, creating a unique style of feminine expression that exists nowhere else in the world.\"**\n\n### The Farray Method®: The Methodology that Changed Everything\n\n**Yunaisy Farray, trained at the prestigious National School of Art of Cuba (ENA), developed the Farray Method® as a complete system for teaching feminine style in dance.** Her methodology prioritizes:\n\n- **Posture and bearing**: The foundation of all elegance and stage presence\n- **Technical arm styling**: Arm movements with precision, grace and musicality\n- **Hip work**: Dissociation, fluidity and controlled undulations\n- **Spinning technique**: Balance, control and multiple turns\n- **Walking in heels**: Elegance, confidence and sensuality in motion\n- **Facial and body expression**: Communicating emotion through dance\n\n**\"The Farray Method® is the only Lady Style teaching system developed by a dancer trained at Cuba's National School of Art, combining technical rigor with Afro-Caribbean expressiveness.\"**\n\n### Technical Elements of Lady Style\n\n**The main techniques of Salsa Lady Style include six fundamental pillars:**\n\n- **Arm styling**: Elegant lines, ballet-influenced port de bras and fluid arm movements that frame the body\n- **Body movement**: Torso undulations, body rolls, body waves and integral body expression\n- **Feminine footwork**: Decorative steps, tap steps, flicks and refined footwork\n- **Spinning technique**: Multiple turns (singles, doubles, triples) with control, spotting and perfect balance\n- **Hip work**: Circular movements, figure eights, dissociation and isolations that express the music\n- **Stage presence**: Projection, gaze, attitude and connection with the audience\n\n**\"Lady Style techniques include arm styling, body movement, feminine footwork, spins, hip work and stage presence, forming a complete system of feminine expression in dance.\"**\n\n### Health Benefits\n\n**A 60-minute Salsa Lady Style class can burn between 300 and 400 calories**, combining intense cardiovascular work with specific muscle toning. Benefits include:\n\n- **Toning**: Legs, glutes, core and arms work in an integrated way\n- **Posture**: Significant improvement in bearing and body alignment\n- **Coordination**: Development of motor coordination and laterality\n- **Flexibility**: Increased range of joint motion\n- **Self-esteem**: Connection with femininity and confidence building\n- **Mental health**: Stress reduction and endorphin release\n\n**\"Lady Style burns between 300-400 calories per hour while toning legs, glutes, core and arms, being one of the most complete exercises for women.\"**\n\n### Lady Style at Farray's Center\n\n**Farray's International Dance Center is the only academy in Barcelona where you can learn Salsa Lady Style directly with Yunaisy Farray**, creator of the Farray Method® and CID-UNESCO member since 2018. Yunaisy, trained at Cuba's National School of Art and internationally recognized for her participation in the movie \"Street Dance 2\" and the show \"Got Talent\", brings a unique combination of classical technique and Afro-Cuban flavor that you won't find anywhere else.\n\n**\"Farray's Center is the only academy in Barcelona with direct teaching from Yunaisy Farray, creator of the Farray Method® and CID-UNESCO member, offering Lady Style with authentic Cuban technique.\"**\n\n### Lady Style Today: Female Empowerment\n\n**Salsa Lady Style has become a tool for female empowerment worldwide**, allowing women to connect with their femininity, gain confidence and express themselves freely through dance. It's not just a technical discipline: it's a path of personal development that transforms how women perceive themselves and move through the world.",

  "dancehallCulturalFull": "### The Origins: Kingston, Jamaica (1970s-1980s)\\n\\nDancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 1970s. It emerged as a natural evolution of reggae when sound systems (mobile sound systems) started bringing music to the streets and dancehalls (dance halls). The name \\\"dancehall\\\" comes from those spaces where the community gathered to dance, socialize, and express themselves. It was the place where social tensions were released through music and movement.\\n\\n### The Legends: Bogle, Passa Passa, and the Pioneers\\n\\n**Gerald \\\"Bogle\\\" Levy (1964-2005) is considered the father of modern Dancehall.** He created iconic moves like **Bogle, Row Di Boat, Log On, and Willie Bounce**, the foundation of Dancehall vocabulary.\\n\\n**Passa Passa**, the legendary street dancehall sessions in Tivoli Gardens (Kingston), was the epicenter where new steps were born and dancers were consecrated.\\n\\nOther pioneers like **Ding Dong, Keiva, John Hype** and crews like **Ravers Clavers** took Dancehall to an international level in the 2000s.\\n\\n### The Global Expansion (2000s-Present)\\n\\nIn the 2000s, Dancehall exploded globally thanks to artists like **Sean Paul, Shaggy, Elephant Man, and Beenie Man**. Social media and YouTube popularized moves like **Dutty Wine, Daggering, and Nuh Linga**.\\n\\nToday, Dancehall is a worldwide phenomenon with active communities in Europe, Africa, Asia, and America; Barcelona is one of its European epicenters.\\n\\n### The Music: Riddims and Sound System Culture\\n\\n**Dancehall is danced to riddims (instrumental tracks) that producers create and multiple artists vocalize.** Legendary riddims like **Diwali, Coolie Dance, or Dump Truck** defined entire eras.\\n\\nThe sound system culture—with its selectors, MCs, and the famous rewind when a song is so good it gets played again from the beginning—is essential to understanding Dancehall.\\n\\n### More Than Dance: Identity and Resistance\\n\\nDancehall has always been a form of cultural resistance and identity expression for Jamaica's marginalized communities. It's the voice of the ghettos, a celebration of joy despite difficulties.\\n\\nEach step has meaning: **Log On** (connect), **Willie Bounce** (tribute to Willie Haggart), **Nuh Linga** (don't linger). Every movement tells a story.\\n\\n### Dancehall at Farray's: technique and community\\n\\nAt Farray's International Dance Center, Dancehall is taught with technique, respect, and historical context, prioritizing good energy, movement precision, and a professional environment.",

  "folkloreWhatIsQuestionAnswer": "If you seek the deepest essence of Cuban dance, yes it is.",
  "folkloreCulturalHistoryTitle": "History and Origin of Cuban Folklore",
  "folkloreCulturalShort": "Cuban Folklore is defined as the set of popular traditions transmitted orally, including ritual dances, music, legends (\"Patakíes\"), and cultural practices of the Cuban population, with strong emphasis on African-descendant roots adapted to the island context.",
  "folkloreCulturalFull": "### Cultural influences\\nSince the 16th century, Cuban folklore emerged from syncretism between African slaves (Yoruba, Congo, Arará), Spanish colonizers (romance, contradanza), and minor Caribbean contributions (Haitian, Jamaican), with almost non-existent aboriginal influence. Plantation socioeconomic conditions transformed African cults into expressions like Santería and Palo, where ritual dances preserve polyrhythm and ancestral gestures.\\n### What is Afro Cuban?\\n**Afro Cuban** (also called \"Afro\" or \"Afro-Cuban dances\") is the term that encompasses all Cuban dance expressions with African roots. When you search for **Afro classes in Barcelona** or **African dances**, Afro Cuban is the discipline that connects Africa with the Caribbean. Unlike pure African dances (Senegalese Sabar, Coupé Décalé), Afro Cuban fuses Yoruba, Congo, and Bantu movements with Caribbean musicality, creating a unique style that is the foundation of Cuban salsa.\\n### Historical evolution\\nIn the 19th century, secret societies and African cabildos maintained dances like Yoruba and Abakuá in religious contexts. In the early 20th century, the Cuban Folklore Society (1923-1930) initiated systematic study, while groups like Los Muñequitos de Matanzas professionalized rumba. Post-1959, institutions like the National School of Art codified these forms for stage.\\n### Main manifestations\\nTraditional folklore includes:\\n**Yoruba:** Dances to Orishas (Eleguá, Yemayá, Obatalá, Ochún, Changó).\\n**Congo/Bantu:** Palo, Makuta, Garabato.\\n**Abakuá:** Efo, Efi.\\n**Arará:** Afra, Gun, Jebbioso.\\n**Iyesá:** Iyesá Dances.\\n**Haitian:** Voodoo, Sabone, Fey, Congo Laye, Gagá, Tumba Francesa, Haitian Merengue, Ibbo, Menua.\\n**Jamaican:** Banana, Brown, Mangú, Chulo, Cinta, Limbo.\\n**Rumba:** Guaguancó, Yambú, and Columbia. Columbia includes: traditional Columbia, Jiribilla, and variants with objects (machetes, knives, cane, plate with candle, scarf, among others).\\n### Influence on popular dances\\nFolkloric rhythms and movements nourish secular genres like Conga, Comparsa, Son Montuno (Changüí, Sucu-sucu), Danzón, and Casino, the basis of modern Cuban salsa, fusing batá percussion with danceable structures.\\n### Afro Cuban Classes in Barcelona\\nFarray\\'s International Dance Center is the reference academy for learning **Afro Cuban in Barcelona**. Our specialized Cuban masters connect you with Yoruba and Congolese roots, elevating your body expression in salsa and Latin rhythms. If you\\'re looking for **Afro classes**, **African dances**, or **Afro Cuban in Barcelona**, here you\\'ll find the most authentic training.",

  "folkloreFaqTitle": "Frequently asked questions about Cuban Folklore in Barcelona",
  "folkloreFaqQ1": "What exactly is Cuban Folklore?",
  "folkloreFaqA1": "Cuban Folklore is the set of traditional Cuban dances with African roots. It includes ritual dances to the Orishas (Santería), dances of Yoruba, Congo, Arará origin, as well as Rumba in its different variants (Guaguancó, Yambú, Columbia). It is the foundation from which all Cuban salsa emerges.",
  "folkloreFaqQ2": "Do I need prior experience to learn Cuban Folklore?",
  "folkloreFaqA2": "You do not need any prior experience. Our classes are designed to welcome all levels, from absolute beginners to advanced dancers who want to deepen their roots.",
  "folkloreFaqQ3": "Is Cuban Folklore related to religion?",
  "folkloreFaqA3": "Cuban folklore has its origin in Afro-Cuban religious traditions (Santería, Palo, etc.), but in our classes, we teach it as an artistic and cultural discipline. You learn the movements and their historical-cultural meaning, without any mandatory religious component.",
  "folkloreFaqQ4": "Who are the Orishas and what dances will I learn?",
  "folkloreFaqA4": "The Orishas are the deities of the Yoruba religion syncretized in Cuba. Each one has their own characteristic dance: Eleguá (the messenger), Ochún (sensuality), Yemayá (the sea), Changó (fire), Obatalá (peace), among others. You will learn the specific movements of each one.",
  "folkloreFaqQ5": "How will Folklore help me dance salsa better?",
  "folkloreFaqA5": "Folklore is the root of Cuban salsa. By learning folklore, you will develop better musical interpretation, more authentic body expression, body isolation, and deep understanding of percussion. All of this translates directly into richer and more authentic salsa dancing.",
  "folkloreFaqQ6": "What clothes do I need for classes?",
  "folkloreFaqA6": "Comfortable, light clothing that allows freedom of movement, especially in hips and torso. You can use clean studio shoes or dance barefoot if you prefer. Bring a towel and water because it is intense training.",
  "folkloreFaqQ7": "Are there classes for men or only for women?",
  "folkloreFaqA7": "Cuban folklore is for everyone. In fact, many dances to the Orishas have very powerful masculine versions (like Changó or Ogún). Men and women are welcome in all our classes.",
  "folkloreFaqQ8": "Can I try a class before enrolling?",
  "folkloreFaqA8": "Yes. We offer a welcome class so you can experience our methodology without commitment. Book your spot by clicking the \"Book Your Welcome Class\" button on this page.",
  "folkloreFaqQ9": "Do you organize folklore events or performances?",
  "folkloreFaqA9": "Yes. We organize our annual gala where students can showcase what they've learned in a professional theater. We also hold workshops with guest masters and participate in cultural events in the city.",
  "folkloreFaqQ10": "Where is the academy and how do I contact you?",
  "folkloreFaqA10": "We are at Calle Entença 100, 08015 Barcelona (5 min from Plaza España and Sants).<br/><br/>📞 <strong>Phone:</strong> <a href=\"tel:+34622247085\" class=\"text-primary-accent hover:underline\">+34 622 247 085</a><br/>📧 <strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:info@farrayscenter.com\" class=\"text-primary-accent hover:underline\">info@farrayscenter.com</a><br/>🌐 <strong>Web:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.farrayscenter.com/contacto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-primary-accent hover:underline\">www.farrayscenter.com/contacto</a>",
  "folkloreFaqQ11": "What is Afro Cuban and how does it differ from Cuban Folklore?",
  "folkloreFaqA11": "Afro Cuban is the term that encompasses all Cuban dances with African roots. Cuban Folklore includes Afro Cuban plus other expressions like Rumba and Comparsa dances. In our Folklore classes you will learn both aspects: the Afro dances to the Orishas (Eleguá, Changó, Yemayá, Ochún) and the more festive manifestations like Rumba.",
  "folkloreFaqQ12": "Can I learn African dances in Barcelona with you?",
  "folkloreFaqA12": "Yes. Afro Cuban is the most authentic way to connect with African dances in Barcelona. Our movements come directly from Yoruba, Congo, and Bantu traditions that arrived in Cuba with African slaves. If you are looking for African dance classes, Afro Cuban offers that connection with authentic roots plus the rhythmic richness of the Caribbean.",
  "folkloreFaqQ13": "What is the difference between Afro Cuban and Afrobeat or Afro Contemporary?",
  "folkloreFaqA13": "Afro Cuban is based on Yoruba and Congo ritual dances adapted in Cuba (16th-19th centuries). Afrobeat is a Nigerian musical genre from the 70s with its own dance. Afro Contemporary fuses African techniques with modern contemporary dance. At Farray's we offer all three disciplines, but Afro Cuban is the one that connects with the oldest roots and salsa.",
  "folkloreFaqQ14": "Will Afro Cuban classes help me improve in other styles?",
  "folkloreFaqA14": "Absolutely. Afro Cuban is the foundation of Cuban salsa, son, timba, and many Latin rhythms. By learning the gestures of the Orishas, the polyrhythm of batá drums, and African body dissociation, your dancing in any Latin style will improve significantly. Many salsa dancers come to our Afro classes to deepen their practice.",

  "timbaCulturalHistoryTitle": "History and Origins of Cuban Timba",
  "timbaCulturalShort": "Timba was born in Cuba in the 80s-90s as an evolution of Son and Salsa, fusing traditional African rhythms with modern genres.",
  "timbaCulturalFull": "### The Origins of Timba (Cuba, 1980s-1990s)\n\n**Timba emerged in Havana during the 80s and reached its peak expression in the 90s.** It is the result of the natural evolution of Cuban music, when young Cuban musicians began fusing traditional Son with influences from funk, hip hop, rock and jazz. This revolutionary fusion created an explosive genre that transformed the way Cuban salsa is danced.\n\n**\"Cuban Timba (1980s-1990s): fusion of traditional Son + funk + hip hop + rock + jazz; musical revolution that transformed Cuban dance.\"**\n\n### Why is it called \"Timba\"?\n\n**The term \"Timba\" has roots in popular Cuban slang.** Some relate it to \"timbales\" (percussion instrument), others to popular Cuban expressions denoting flavor and authenticity. What everyone agrees on is that it represents something intense, street-wise and authentic from Cuban culture.\n\n**\"Timba = intensity + street + authenticity; Cuban slang term that defines the essence of the genre.\"**\n\n### The Bands that Defined the Genre\n\n**Groups like Los Van Van, NG La Banda, La Charanga Habanera, Manolín \"El Médico de la Salsa\" and Paulito FG were the pioneers who defined the Timba sound.** Their music is characterized by:\n\n- **Constant rhythm changes** (from soft to explosive)\n- **The \"despelote\"** - sections where the rhythm intensifies and dancers improvise\n- **Urban lyrics** that talk about everyday Cuban life\n- **Improvisation** both musical and in dance\n\n**\"Timba pioneers: Los Van Van, NG La Banda, La Charanga Habanera, Paulito FG; creators of the sound that defines the genre.\"**\n\n### Timba as Dance: The Despelote\n\n**Musically, Timba demands a different dance than traditional salsa.** Dancers developed looser, more sensual and expressive movements to respond to the constant changes in the music. This is how the Timba dance style was born, with its characteristic \"despelote\" (moment of maximum intensity) and freedom of individual movement.\n\n**\"Timba dance = body response to rhythm changes + despelote + free improvisation; requires mastery of musical interpretation.\"**\n\n### Lady Timba: The Cuban Feminine Style\n\n**Lady Timba or \"Timba for women\" focuses on developing the feminine style within this genre.** It emphasizes hip movements, sensuality and body expression, allowing women to shine when they dance alone or when they are \"let go\" in partner dancing. It's a discipline that empowers and develops femininity in dance.\n\n**\"Lady Timba: Cuban feminine style; hip movements + sensuality + body expression to shine in the despelote.\"**\n\n### Timba in Barcelona: Farray's Center\n\n**Timba continues to evolve in Cuba and around the world. In Barcelona, Farray's Center is a reference in teaching authentic Timba** with Cuban teachers who transmit not just the steps, but the feeling and culture behind each movement. Yunaisy Farray (CID-UNESCO) leads the Lady Timba program with professional methodology.\n\n**\"Farray's Center Barcelona: reference in authentic Cuban Timba; CID-UNESCO Cuban teachers; Lady Timba + Partner Timba.\"**\n\n### Benefits of Dancing Timba\n\n**Dancing Timba uniquely develops musicality, coordination and body expression.** The rhythmic complexity of Timba music trains the musical ear and reaction capacity. Additionally, the social character of the dance strengthens confidence and connection with other dancers.\n\n**\"Timba develops: advanced musicality + coordination + body expression + social confidence; comprehensive dancer training.\"**",

  "stretchingCulturalShort": "Stretching has evolved from simple stretches to a scientific discipline that combines anatomy, physiology and techniques from different traditions.",
  "stretchingCulturalFull": "### Origins of Modern Stretching\n\n**Stretching as a scientific discipline has its roots in millennial practices such as yoga (5000+ years) and oriental martial arts.** However, it was in the 1970s that it was systematized as specific training with a scientific basis.\n\n**\"Stretching (Bob Anderson, 1975): first scientific stretching manual, +3.5 million copies sold, basis of modern stretching.\"**\n\n### Bob Anderson and the Stretching Revolution (1975)\n\n**Bob Anderson is considered the father of modern stretching.** His book \"Stretching\" (1975) sold more than 3.5 million copies and was translated into 23 languages, establishing the foundations of what we now know as static stretching. Anderson was the first to systematize stretches with an accessible and scientific approach for the general public.\n\n**\"Bob Anderson (1975): popularized static stretching as an essential complement to physical exercise.\"**\n\n### PNF: Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation\n\n**The Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) technique revolutionized the field of flexibility.** Originally developed for rehabilitation of polio patients in the 1940s-50s by Herman Kabat, it was adapted to sports training in the 80s. Studies show that PNF can increase flexibility up to 30% faster than traditional static stretching.\n\n**\"PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation): combines muscle contraction-relaxation; +30% effectiveness vs. traditional static stretching.\"**\n\n### Backbending: The Art of Posterior Flexibility\n\n**Backbending (posterior spinal flexion) has been refined over generations by gymnasts, ballet dancers and professional contortionists.** Russian and Chinese circus schools have developed specific methodologies that allow working on back flexibility safely and progressively.\n\n**\"Backbending: posterior spinal flexion; technique developed by Olympic gymnasts, ballet dancers and professional contortionists.\"**\n\n### The Farray Method: Fusion of Traditions\n\n**At Farray's Center we have developed our own methodology that combines the best of each tradition:** the patience and body awareness of yoga, the technical rigor of classical ballet, PNF techniques from sports rehabilitation, and knowledge of modern anatomy.\n\nThe Farray Method is characterized by:\n- **Structured progression**: 4 levels (Beginners → Basic → Intermediate → Intermediate/Advanced)\n- **Specialization in backbending and legs**: specific 1h30 classes for deep work\n- **Individualized approach**: adaptation to each body and flexibility level\n- **Scientific basis**: PNF techniques combined with static stretches\n\n**\"Farray Method (Barcelona): fusion yoga + ballet + PNF + modern anatomy; 4 levels of structured progression.\"**\n\n### Scientifically Proven Benefits\n\nScientific studies confirm that regular stretching 3+ times per week:\n\n- **Improves 15-20%** joint range of motion in 4-8 weeks\n- **Reduces 30%** risk of muscle injuries\n- **Relieves** chronic back and neck pain\n- **Improves** blood and lymphatic circulation\n- **Reduces** stress and cortisol levels\n- **Burns 150-200** calories per 60-minute session\n\n**\"Regular stretching: +15-20% flexibility in 4-8 weeks, -30% injury risk, 150-200 cal/hour.\"**",

  "stretchingFaqQ1": "Can I do stretching if I am very stiff?",
  "stretchingFaqA1": "Yes, stretching is especially beneficial for stiff people. The stiffest people are the ones who experience the most improvements. Our Beginners classes are designed to start from scratch: we work on breathing, posture and gentle stretches. With 2-3 classes per week, most notice flexibility improvements in 2-4 weeks.",
  "stretchingFaqQ2": "What is the difference between Beginners and Basic classes?",
  "stretchingFaqA2": "<strong>Beginners (0-3 months)</strong>: for those starting from scratch. You learn diaphragmatic breathing, correct posture and fundamental stretches. Duration: 60 minutes.<br><strong>Basic (3-6 months)</strong>: we increase intensity, work deeper stretches and start PNF techniques (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation). Duration: 60 minutes.",
  "stretchingFaqQ3": "What are Backbending & Legs classes?",
  "stretchingFaqA3": "<strong>Backbending & Legs</strong> classes are specialized 90-minute (1h30) sessions focused on: back flexibility (bridges, extensions), leg elongation (front and side splits), and hamstring strengthening. We use PNF techniques and safe progressions. Available levels: Intermediate and Intermediate/Advanced.",
  "stretchingFaqQ4": "Do I need prior experience for the Intermediate level?",
  "stretchingFaqA4": "For Backbending & Legs Intermediate we recommend: minimum 3-6 months of regular stretching, or baseline flexibility (being able to touch your feet, do a half bridge). If in doubt, try a Beginners class first. For Intermediate/Advanced: +12 months experience or advanced flexibility (partial split, full bridge).",
  "stretchingFaqQ5": "Does stretching help relieve back pain?",
  "stretchingFaqA5": "Yes. Studies show that regular stretching reduces back pain in 30-50% of cases. Stretching strengthens the core, improves posture and releases accumulated muscle tension. At our academy, 80% of students with chronic back pain report significant relief in the first 4-8 weeks of consistent practice.",
  "stretchingFaqQ6": "What should I bring to stretching class?",
  "stretchingFaqA6": "<strong>Required equipment</strong>: comfortable and stretchy clothes (leggings, fitted t-shirt), small towel optional. <strong>You don't need</strong>: shoes (we work barefoot or with socks), mat (we provide it). <strong>Recommended</strong>: water bottle, change of clothes if combining with another class.",
  "stretchingFaqQ7": "Are stretching classes only for dancers?",
  "stretchingFaqA7": "No. Only 30% of our stretching students are dancers. The remaining 70% are: office workers with neck/lower back tension, athletes who want to prevent injuries, people over 40 who want to maintain mobility, and anyone who wants to feel better in their body. Stretching benefits all ages and physical conditions.",
  "stretchingFaqQ8": "How much does the stretching welcome class cost?",
  "stretchingFaqA8": "Depending on the season, the welcome class for residents has a special welcome price. The idea is that you can try the experience without commitment. Reserve your spot by clicking the \"Book Your Welcome Class\" button.",
  "stretchingFaqQ9": "Is there a contract or minimum commitment?",
  "stretchingFaqA9": "There is no contract or minimum commitment. At Farray's Center we work month to month: you only pay for the months you attend. You can pause or cancel at any time without penalties. Total flexibility to adapt to your life.",
  "stretchingFaqQ10": "Can I combine stretching with other academy classes?",
  "stretchingFaqA10": "Yes, it's the ideal combination. Stretching complements any dance style by improving your range of motion and preventing injuries. Recommendation: 1-2 stretching classes per week + your regular dance classes. Many students combine Bachata/Salsa + Stretching or Urban Dances + Backbending & Legs.",
  "stretchingFaqQ11": "How long until I see results in my flexibility?",
  "stretchingFaqA11": "<strong>First 2-4 weeks</strong>: less morning stiffness, less muscle pain, better posture. <strong>1-2 months</strong>: visible increase in range of motion (15-20% more flexibility). <strong>3-6 months</strong>: significant changes (being able to touch your feet, half split). <strong>6-12 months</strong>: advanced goals (full split, bridge). Results with practice 2-3 times per week.",
  "stretchingFaqQ12": "Will stretching help me do the splits?",
  "stretchingFaqA12": "Yes. In Backbending & Legs classes we specifically work towards the front split (legs front-back) and side split (legs to the sides). Estimated time according to initial flexibility: 6-12 months for people with moderate stiffness, 3-6 months if you already have a good base. Consistency (2-3 classes/week) is key.",
  "stretchingFaqQ13": "Can I do stretching if I have an injury?",
  "stretchingFaqA13": "It depends on the injury and its state. <strong>Requirements</strong>: consult with your doctor or physiotherapist first. If you have medical clearance, let us know before class to adapt exercises. <strong>Absolute contraindications</strong>: acute injuries, active disc hernias, recent fractures. Therapeutic stretching can be part of your rehabilitation under medical supervision.",

  "bumbumFaqQ3": "What is hip thrust and why is it so effective?",
  "bumbumFaqA3": "Hip thrust is a hip extension exercise that activates the gluteus maximus more than any other exercise according to electromyography (EMG) studies. It's the #1 recommended exercise by experts like Bret Contreras for developing strong glutes with volume.",
  "bumbumFaqQ4": "How long until I see results in my glutes?",
  "bumbumFaqA4": "<strong>First 2-4 weeks</strong>: you\\'ll notice your glutes feel more \"active\" and firm to the touch. <strong>4-8 weeks</strong>: visible changes in tone and shape. <strong>3-6 months</strong>: noticeable increase in volume and definition. Results with 1 weekly class + complementary exercise.",
  "bumbumFaqQ5": "Does glute training help with lower back pain?",
  "bumbumFaqA5": "Yes. Physiotherapy studies show that strengthening the glutes reduces lower back pain by up to 50%. Strong glutes stabilize the pelvis and reduce load on the lower back. Many of our students notice significant relief.",
  "bumbumFaqQ6": "What should I bring to Bum Bum Glutes class?",
  "bumbumFaqA6": "<strong>Required equipment</strong>: comfortable workout clothes (leggings, t-shirt), athletic shoes, small towel, water bottle. <strong>Optional</strong>: resistance bands (we provide them).",
  "bumbumFaqQ7": "Is it only for women?",
  "bumbumFaqA7": "No. Although most participants are women, men can also benefit greatly from glute training. Strong glutes improve athletic performance, prevent injuries and improve posture in anyone.",
  "bumbumFaqQ8": "How much does the Bum Bum Glutes welcome class cost?",

  "bumbumFaqQ11": "How many calories are burned in a class?",
  "bumbumFaqA11": "A 60-minute Bum Bum Amazing Glutes class burns approximately 300-400 calories, depending on your body weight and intensity. It's strength training with an aerobic component thanks to the dance techniques.",
  "bumbumFaqQ12": "Does glute training increase volume or just tone?",
  "bumbumFaqA12": "Both. Exercises like hip thrust and squats develop muscle (hypertrophy), which increases volume. At the same time, regular training reduces body fat and improves muscle definition. The result is glutes that are both larger AND more toned.",
  "bumbumFaqQ13": "Can I do Bum Bum Glutes if I have knee problems?",
  "bumbumFaqA13": "It depends on the specific condition. Hip thrust is generally safe for knees because it doesn't involve deep flexion. However, we recommend consulting with your doctor first and letting Cris know at the start of class to adapt exercises.",

  "bachataLadyCulturalFull": "### The Evolution of Bachata Lady Style\n\nBachata lady style builds on the evolution of bachata from its traditional roots in the Dominican Republic to today's urban and sensual bachata, where the dancer's prominence grows with the use of adornments, body isolations and body expression.\n\n**\"Bachata Lady Style: a line of technical and expressive work that develops the feminine style within modern bachata, focused on arm styling, body waves, hips and stage presence.\"**\n\n### History and Origin of Bachata\n\nBachata was born in the Dominican Republic in the mid-20th century as popular guitar music, influenced by bolero, son and other Caribbean genres. For decades it was associated with humble environments and suburban bars, until in the 80s-90s it became professionalized and began its international expansion thanks to artists like Juan Luis Guerra and the Latin industry.\n\n**\"Bachata was born in the Dominican Republic (mid-20th century): popular guitar music influenced by bolero, son and Caribbean genres. International expansion in the 80s-90s with Juan Luis Guerra.\"**\n\n### From Traditional Bachata to Urban Bachata\n\nWith the global spread of bachata since the 2000s, new scenic and urban styles emerged (modern, urban and sensual bachata), incorporating influences from ballroom, jazz, contemporary and urban dances. In this context, specific \"ladies styling / lady style\" classes appeared, where women work on spins, body waves, lines and attitude on the bachata base, both in partners and solo.\n\n**\"Bachata Lady Style emerged in the 2010s with the globalization of sensual bachata, when female dancers sought spaces to develop feminine technique independently.\"**\n\n### What is Bachata Lady Style?\n\nBachata lady style is the line of technical and expressive work that develops the feminine style within modern bachata. It focuses on arm usage (arm styling), torso and hip isolation, weight control, walking with presence and feminine gestures, so the dancer can shine in solo moments or shines within partner dancing.\n\n**\"Bachata Lady Style: arm styling (elegant arm work), body movement (waves and rolls), hip work (figure eights, accents), spins with spotting, and stage presence.\"**\n\n### Technical Elements of Bachata Lady Style\n\nIn bachata lady style classes we work on elements such as:\n\n**Arm styling:** elegant lines, fluidity and coordination with the torso.\n\n**Body movement:** waves, rolls, inclinations and level changes.\n\n**Hips:** lateral movements, figure eights and soft or accented marks.\n\n**Spins:** clean technique, spotting and balance.\n\n**Stage presence:** gaze, attitude, musicality and connection with lyrics.\n\n**\"An active Bachata Lady Style class can burn 250-400 calories per hour depending on intensity and heel use.\"**\n\n### Lady Style and Female Empowerment\n\nLike salsa lady style, bachata lady style has become a tool for female empowerment in dance schools worldwide. It offers women a space to work on self-esteem, sensuality and confidence in their movement, beyond the traditional follower role.\n\n**\"Bachata Lady Style has become a tool for female empowerment, offering space to work on self-esteem, sensuality and body confidence.\"**\n\n### Bachata Lady Style in Barcelona\n\nIn cities like Barcelona, bachata lady style is part of the regular offering of academies specializing in Latin rhythms, where modern bachata technique is combined with jazz, contemporary or urban bases to refine style. In this context, schools like Farray's International Dance Center integrate lady style work within their global approach to Latin and urban dance, emphasizing musicality, technique and each dancer's own personality.\n\n**\"Farray's International Dance Center: Bachata Lady Style with proprietary methodology, small groups, 4.9/5 Google rating with over 500 reviews.\"**",

  "bachataV3CulturalShort": "Bachata was born in the Dominican Republic in the 1960s as music of popular neighborhoods. What started as music stigmatized by the upper classes became a global phenomenon.",
  "bachataV3CulturalFull": "### From Dominican Neighborhoods to Dance Floors Around the World\n\nBachata has its roots in the Dominican Republic, where it was born in the 1960s as the music of humble neighborhoods. For decades it was marginalized by the upper classes, considered cantina music. Everything changed in the 1990s when artists like Juan Luis Guerra brought it into the international mainstream.\n\n**\"Bachata was born in the Dominican Republic (1960s): guitar music from popular neighborhoods that evolved to conquer the world.\"**\n\n### The Sensual Bachata Revolution\n\nIn the 2000s, European dancers (especially in Spain) began fusing traditional bachata with elements of zouk, contemporary dance, and tango. Thus sensual bachata was born: a style that prioritizes body waves, intimate connection, and musical interpretation.\n\n**\"Sensual Bachata: modern evolution (2000s) that fuses Dominican bachata with zouk, contemporary, and tango. Prioritizes body waves, connection, and musicality.\"**\n\n### Sensual Bachata vs Dominican Bachata\n\nTraditional Dominican bachata is characterized by fast footwork, pronounced hip movements, and a more \"street\" style. Sensual bachata, on the other hand, emphasizes body movement, waves between dancers, dips, and a closer connection.\n\n**\"Key difference: Dominican = footwork and hips. Sensual = body waves, dips, and intimate connection.\"**\n\n### Sensual Bachata in Barcelona\n\nBarcelona has become one of the world epicenters of sensual bachata. Festivals, congresses, and an active community of dancers make the city a must-visit destination for dance lovers. At Farray's Center, we teach sensual bachata with internationally renowned instructors.\n\n**\"Farray's International Dance Center: sensual bachata with world champions, CID-UNESCO certification, +15,000 students trained.\"**",
  "bachataV3FaqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions about Sensual Bachata",
  "bachataV3FaqSubtitle": "We answer your doubts so you can dance with confidence.",
  "bachataV3FaqQ1": "What is sensual bachata and how is it different from other bachata styles?",
  "bachataV3FaqA1": "Sensual bachata is a modern evolution of Dominican bachata that emphasizes body connection, musical interpretation and fluid movements like waves and dips. Unlike Dominican bachata (faster, with more footwork) or bachata fusion (mixed with other styles), sensual bachata focuses on couple connection and body expression. At Farray's we mainly teach sensual bachata, although we touch on elements of social bachata and bachata fusion in advanced classes.",
  "bachataV3FaqQ2": "Do I need a partner to learn bachata at Farray's?",
  "bachataV3FaqA2": "No, you don't need to come with a partner. In our classes we rotate partners constantly, which is actually better for learning because you learn to dance with different people. Many of our students come alone and that's how they meet friends and even partners.",
  "bachataV3FaqQ3": "What is the difference between sensual bachata and Dominican bachata?",
  "bachataV3FaqA3": "Dominican bachata is the original style, faster, with more footwork and closer to Dominican roots. Sensual bachata is a European evolution that focuses more on body connection, waves and dips. At Farray's we teach sensual bachata as the main style because it's the most danced at European socials, but we include Dominican technique elements to give you a solid foundation.",
  "bachataV3FaqQ4": "How long does it take to learn sensual bachata?",
  "bachataV3FaqA4": "In 3 months of regular classes you will be able to dance comfortably at any social. In 6 months you will feel like a completely different dancer. Of course, bachata is an art that you keep perfecting your whole life, but to enjoy socials, 3-6 months is enough.",
  "bachataV3FaqQ5": "What bachata level do I need to dance at social parties?",
  "bachataV3FaqA5": "With our basic level (about 3 months) you can already enjoy social bachata parties. You will know enough moves to have fun and connect with your partner. At socials you dance with all levels, so you will always find people to dance with.",
  "bachataV3FaqQ6": "Can I learn bachata without previous dance experience?",
  "bachataV3FaqA6": "Absolutely! Many of our students have never danced before. Our beginner class is designed specifically for people starting from zero. You don't need rhythm, experience or special abilities. We teach you everything.",
  "bachataV3FaqQ7": "What is bachata fusion and do you teach it at Farray's?",
  "bachataV3FaqA7": "Bachata fusion is a style that mixes bachata with elements of hip hop, contemporary, zouk and other dances. At Farray's our main focus is sensual bachata, but our advanced teachers include fusion elements in their choreographies. If you are specifically interested in fusion, ask about our masterclasses and special events.",
  "bachataV3FaqQ8": "What is Farray's bachata teaching method?",
  "bachataV3FaqA8": "Our method combines solid technique with fun and creative expression. We start with basics (rhythm, basic step, simple turns), progress to body connection and waves, and finally work on musicality and personal style. Our teachers are world champions who have adapted their knowledge for all levels.",
  "bachataV3FaqQ9": "Are there bachata social events at Farray's?",

  "cuerpofitFaqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions about Body Conditioning",
  "cuerpofitFaqQ1": "Do I need to be a dancer to do body conditioning?",
  "cuerpofitFaqA1": "It's not essential, although the class is designed with dance demands in mind. If you practice any type of dance (urban, Latin, contemporary, etc.), you'll benefit enormously. It's also ideal for athletes who want to improve flexibility and body control, or anyone seeking complete functional training.",
  "cuerpofitFaqQ2": "What's the difference between body conditioning and Pilates?",
  "cuerpofitFaqA2": "Body conditioning is broader and incorporates Pilates elements, but also functional yoga, bodyweight strength training, joint mobility and dance-specific exercises. Pilates focuses mainly on core and posture; body conditioning works the whole body with a focus on movement performance.",
  "cuerpofitFaqQ3": "What's the difference between body conditioning and stretching classes?",
  "cuerpofitFaqA3": "Stretching focuses on increasing passive and active flexibility. Body conditioning is more comprehensive: it works strength, endurance, mobility and flexibility. They're complementary: many students do both classes. Stretching to gain range of motion, body conditioning to strengthen it.",
  "cuerpofitFaqQ4": "Is it an intense class? Will I be exhausted?",
  "cuerpofitFaqA4": "The intensity is moderate-high but controlled. It's not HIIT or CrossFit. It's conscious strength and control work. You'll be tired but not destroyed. The class is designed so you can take other dance classes afterward without problem.",
  "cuerpofitFaqQ5": "What should I bring to class?",
  "cuerpofitFaqA5": "Comfortable workout clothes that allow wide movement (leggings, fitted t-shirt or top). Barefoot or with socks (no shoes). Small towel and water bottle. We provide the mats.",
  "cuerpofitFaqQ6": "Does it help prevent dance injuries?",
  "cuerpofitFaqA6": "Yes, it's one of the main objectives. Studies show that dancers with regular strength training have 50-70% fewer injuries. Body conditioning strengthens the most vulnerable areas (hips, knees, ankles, back) and corrects muscular imbalances.",
  "cuerpofitFaqQ7": "How much does the welcome class cost?",
  "cuerpofitFaqA7": "The welcome class costs 10€ and has no commitment. You can try any Monday at 7pm. If you like it, there are monthly passes from 40€. Check all prices at reception or on our website.",
  "cuerpofitFaqQ8": "Is there a contract or commitment?",
  "cuerpofitFaqA8": "No. Monthly passes without commitment. You can come and go as you please. We value your freedom and want you to come because you want to, not because you're tied to a contract.",
  "cuerpofitFaqQ9": "Can I combine body conditioning with other classes?",
  "cuerpofitFaqA9": "Yes, it's the ideal combination. We recommend: body conditioning (physical foundation) + your regular dance classes + optional stretching. Many students combine Monday body conditioning + Tuesday/Thursday dance. Our passes allow flexible combinations.",
  "cuerpofitFaqQ10": "How long until I see results?",

  "fullBodyCardioFaqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions about Cuerpo-Fit",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ1": "How many calories do you burn in Cuerpo-Fit?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA1": "En una session for Cuerpo-Fit de 60 minutos se queman aproximadamente <strong>400-500 calories</strong>, dependiendo de tu peso e intensidad. Es equivalente a 45 minutos de running, but much more fun and with less impact on the joints. The combined work of cardio and toning keeps your metabolism active even after class (EPOC effect).",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ2": "Do I need to know how to dance to do Cuerpo-Fit?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA2": "No. Cuerpo-Fit is not a dance class, it's functional training with music. The movements are fitness exercises (squats, lunges, core...) sequenced to the rhythm of music. There are no choreographies to memorize. If you can walk, you can do Cuerpo-Fit.",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ3": "What's the difference between Cuerpo-Fit and the gym?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA3": "<strong>Cuerpo-Fit</strong>: group training with music, functional exercises, without machines, guaranteed fun, adapted in real time. <strong>Gym</strong>: isolated machines, monotonous repetitions, without guidance (usually). Same caloric expenditure, but Cuerpo-Fit has better adherence because it's not boring.",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ4": "What clothes should I wear to Cuerpo-Fit?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA4": "<strong>Required clothing</strong>: ropa deportiva cómoda (leggings, camiseta transpirable), zapatillas de deporte. <strong>Recomendado</strong>: toalla pequeña, botella de agua. <strong>No necesitas</strong>: special dance clothes or extra equipment (we provide everything).",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ5": "Is it suitable for absolute beginners?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA5": "Sí, 100%. Cuerpo-Fit is open level designed for everyone. Each exercise has <strong>3 intensity levels</strong>: bajo (principiantes), medio (intermedios), alto (avanzados). Tú eliges en cada momento. Cris adapts and corrects in real time. Many of our students started without having set foot in a gym in years.",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ6": "How often should I do Cuerpo-Fit to see results?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA6": "Con <strong>1 weekly class</strong> ya notarás cambios en energía y ánimo. For visible toning results, we recommend <strong>2 sesiones semanales</strong> (you can combine with other classes at the academy). La constancia es más importante que the intensity. Better 1 class each week for months than 5 classes one week and then nothing.",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ7": "Can I do Cuerpo-Fit if I'm overweight?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA7": "Sí. Cuerpo-Fit is especially effective for people who want to lose weight because: it works the whole body (more caloric expenditure), the exercises are low impact (they take care of the joints), and each movement has lower intensity variations. Many students with excess weight choose Cuerpo-Fit precisely because they don't feel judged and can go at their own pace.",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ8": "What muscles do I work in Cuerpo-Fit?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA8": "Cuerpo-Fit es <strong>full body</strong>, works all major muscle groups: <strong>Tren inferior</strong>: cuádriceps, isquiotibiales, glúteos, gemelos. <strong>Core</strong>: abdominales, oblicuos, espalda baja. <strong>Tren superior</strong>: arms, shoulders, back, chest. En 60 minutos activamos más del 60% de tu masa muscular total.",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ9": "How long does it take to see results?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA9": "<strong>Semanas 1-2</strong>: más energía, mejor humor, mejor sueño. <strong>Semanas 3-4</strong>: clothes start to fit differently, more strength in daily activities. <strong>Meses 1-2</strong>: cambios visibles en tonificación, resistencia cardiovascular mejorada. <strong>Mes 3+</strong>: transformation notable, nuevos hábitos consolidados. Resultados with practice regular de 1-2 times per week.",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ10": "¿Hay classes for Cuerpo-Fit for mayores de 40 o 50 years?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA10": "Sí, tenemos alumnos de todas las edades, desde 20 to 60+ years. Cuerpo-Fit is especially recommended for people over 40 because: it maintains muscle mass (which starts to be lost with age), improves bone density, is low impact (takes care of joints), and each exercise adapts to your level. Age is not an excuse, it's a reason to start.",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ11": "¿Cómo es una class típica for Cuerpo-Fit?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA11": "<strong>Calentamiento (10 min)</strong>: activación cardiovascular suave, movilidad articular. <strong>Bloque principal (40 min)</strong>: circuitos de full body exercises al ritmo de la music, combinando cardio y tonificación, with pausas activas. <strong>Vuelta a la calma (10 min)</strong>: estiramientos, respiración, relajación. All guided by Cris with motivating music in the background.",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ12": "What intensity level does the class have?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA12": "Intensidad <strong>moderada-alta</strong>, pero siempre adaptable. Cuerpo-Fit works with the principle of \"choose your intensity\": cada ejercicio tiene versión suave (principiantes), media (intermedios) e intensa (avanzados). Tú decides en cada momento cuánto das. La idea es que termines sudando pero sonriendo, no arrastrándote.",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ13": "Can I do Cuerpo-Fit if I have injuries?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA13": "Depende de la lesión. <strong>Requisitos</strong>: consult with your doctor or physiotherapist first. If you have medical clearance, let us know before class to adapt exercises. <strong>Contraindicaciones absolutas</strong>: lesiones agudas, problemas cardíacos no controlados, embarazo de riesgo. Cris can modify exercises for most common limitations (knees, back, shoulders).",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqQ14": "¿Cuánto cuesta la class for Cuerpo-Fit?",
  "fullBodyCardioFaqA14": "Cuerpo-Fit is included in the academy's monthly memberships. <strong>Trial class</strong>: consulta condiciones actuales en recepción o web. <strong>Bono mensual</strong>: gives you access to Cuerpo-Fit and other classes at the academy. <strong>No commitment</strong>: you pay month to month, without commitment.

  "kpopCulturalFull": "### Definition: What is K-Pop Dance?\\n\\n**K-Pop Dance is the dance style that accompanies Korean pop music (Korean Pop), characterized by synchronized, precise, and visually stunning choreographies.** Although K-Pop as a musical genre has its roots in the 1990s with pioneering groups like Seo Taiji and Boys (1992), the dance style has evolved enormously, fusing elements of American hip hop, jazz, contemporary, vogueing, and urban styles.\\n\\n### The Origins: From Seoul to the World\\n\\nThe debut of Seo Taiji and Boys on April 11, 1992, on Korean television is considered the starting point of modern K-Pop. Their fusion of American hip hop with Korean sensibilities had a significant impact on the Asian music industry. From there, Korean entertainment agencies (SM, YG, JYP, HYBE) developed a rigorous training system that includes years of practice in singing, dancing, languages, and performance.\\n\\n### The Golden Era: 2010-present\\n\\nK-Pop achieved worldwide recognition with groups like **BTS** (2013), **BLACKPINK** (2016), **Stray Kids** (2018), **TWICE** (2015), **aespa** (2020), and **NewJeans** (2022). BTS became the first K-Pop group to top the Billboard Hot 100 with \\\"Dynamite\\\" (2020), while BLACKPINK accumulated YouTube view records.\\n\\n### Technical Elements of K-Pop Dance\\n\\n- **Group synchronization**: Multiple dancers executing identical movements with millimetric precision\\n- **Point moves**: Iconic movements designed to be recognizable and viral\\n- **Facial expression**: Fundamental in K-Pop; idols train to convey specific emotions during each song\\n- **Formations**: Complex position changes that create visual patterns from the viewer's perspective\\n- **Style versatility**: A single song can combine hip hop, contemporary, and voguing sections\\n\\n### Benefits of K-Pop Dance\\n\\n- **Physical fitness**: K-Pop choreographies are physically demanding and provide a complete cardiovascular workout\\n- **Coordination and memory**: Learning complex sequences improves muscular and cognitive memory\\n- **Artistic expression**: Combines technique with emotional interpretation\\n- **Community**: K-Pop has a highly engaged global fan community\\n- **Mental health**: Regular dance practice can help reduce stress and improve mood\\n\\n### The Phenomenon in Barcelona\\n\\nBarcelona has a constantly growing K-Pop community, with regular events, cover competitions, and an active scene of fans and dancers. Random dance plays (events where choreographies are danced randomly in public spaces) attract numerous participants at various locations throughout the city.\\n\\n### K-Pop Dance at Farray's Center\\n\\n**Farray's International Dance Center**, located at **Calle Entença 100, Eixample district, Barcelona**, is a CID UNESCO recognized academy offering training in multiple urban styles. With over 15,000 students trained since 2012 and a 4.9/5 rating on Google with over 500 reviews, the academy combines professionalism with a family-friendly and inclusive environment.\\n\\n**Academy details:**\\n- **Address:** Calle Entença 100, 08015 Barcelona\\n- **Access:** Metro L1/L3 (Plaça Espanya), L5 (Entença), Rodalies (Barcelona-Sants)\\n- **Facilities:** +700 m², rooms with mirrors, professional sound, air conditioning",

It's the style that moves the entertainment industry.",
  "commercialWhatIsP2": "It all started in 1983, when Michael Jackson revolutionized the world with \"Beat It\" and \"Thriller.\" For the first time, millions of people saw synchronized choreography fusing hip hop, jazz, and urban styles in music video format.

  "commercialCulturalHistoryTitle": "Want to know more about Commercial Dance?",
  "commercialCulturalShort": "Commercial Dance was born in 1983 with Michael Jackson's music videos and has become the dominant style in the music industry. It fuses hip hop, jazz funk, contemporary, and heels. In Barcelona, Farray's International Dance Center has been teaching commercial styles since 2012, training dancers for the entertainment industry.",
  "commercialCulturalFull": "### What exactly is Commercial Dance?\n\n**Commercial Dance is the dance style you see in music videos, concerts, TV commercials, and live shows.** It's also known as \"Industry Dance\" or \"Video Dance.\" Unlike freestyle or hip hop battles, Commercial is choreographed specifically for recordings and major productions.\n\nWhat sets Commercial apart from other styles is its **versatility**: it mixes hip hop, jazz, contemporary, heels, and any technique that works for the song or artist. It doesn't have a fixed \"syllabus\" like ballet. It's chameleon-like and constantly evolves with trends.\n\n### 1983: The year that changed everything\n\nWhile dance has always existed in entertainment, **1983 was the year modern Commercial Dance was born**. That year, Michael Jackson released the music videos for \"Beat It\" and \"Thriller,\" choreographed by Michael Peters and Vincent Paterson.\n\nFor the first time, millions of people worldwide saw synchronized choreography with formations, fusing urban styles with theatrical technique. MTV had just been born (1981) and these videos proved that dance could be as much of a star as the music.\n\n### The pioneers who defined the style\n\nIn the 80s and 90s, four choreographers laid the foundation for what we know today:\n\n- **Vincent Paterson**: Choreographed \"Smooth Criminal\" and \"Bad\" by Michael Jackson, plus Madonna shows.\n- **Paula Abdul**: Went from being a Lakers cheerleader to defining the aesthetic of 80s-90s music videos.\n- **Tina Landon**: Her work with Janet Jackson on \"Rhythm Nation\" and \"If\" defined an era.\n- **Fatima Robinson**: Innovated with Aaliyah, Michael Jackson, and the Backstreet Boys.\n\n### The golden era: 90s-2000s\n\nChoreographers like Laurieann Gibson, Dave Scott, and Brian Friedman took Commercial to its peak with artists like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Usher, and Destiny's Child. The style was characterized by:\n\n- Clean, precise, powerful movements\n- Complex formations and dynamic changes\n- Intense facial expression that connects with the camera\n- Style fusion according to the artist's needs\n\n### Commercial Dance today (2024-2025)\n\nThe industry has evolved enormously. These are some of the choreographers defining the current visual sound:\n\n**Parris Goebel** (New Zealand): Creator of the \"polyswagg\" style, she has worked with Rihanna, Justin Bieber (\"Sorry\"), and Jennifer Lopez. In 2024, she choreographed Doja Cat's historic Coachella show (first female rapper to headline) and Lady Gaga's \"Disease\" music video. In 2025, she co-directed and choreographed Lady Gaga's \"Abracadabra\" and her Coachella + Mayhem Ball Tour. She was also artistic director and choreographer of Vogue World Paris 2024.\n\n**JaQuel Knight** (USA): Creator of Beyoncé's iconic \"Single Ladies\" dance. He made history in 2020 by becoming the first choreographer to copyright his choreography. In 2024, he made his Broadway debut choreographing \"The Wiz\" revival and directed Chris Stapleton's \"Think I'm in Love with You\" music video.\n\n**Sean Bankhead** (USA): Danced with Usher at Super Bowl LVIII (2024). His choreographies include \"Industry Baby\" by Lil Nas X, \"Motivation\" and \"Wild Side\" by Normani, \"2 Hands\" and \"It's Ok I'm Ok\" by Tate McRae, \"Rockstar\" and \"New Woman\" by Lisa (BLACKPINK), and \"On My Mama\" by Victoria Monét. Choreographer for the 2024 MTV VMAs (Lisa and GloRilla).\n\nK-Pop has also transformed Commercial Dance into a global industry, with choreographers from Korea, the US, and Europe constantly collaborating.\n\n### What do you work on in Commercial Dance?\n\n- **Camera presence**: Knowing which angles flatter you and how to express with your gaze\n- **Isolations**: Precise body control, moving one body part while the rest stays still\n- **Grooves**: The rhythmic foundation of hip hop that gives movement its \"flavor\"\n- **Performance quality**: That extra energy that brings choreography to life\n- **Versatility**: Ability to adapt to different musical genres and choreographic styles\n\n### Commercial Dance in Barcelona\n\n**Farray's International Dance Center**, in the **Eixample district (Calle Entença 100, between Plaza España and Sants)**, is one of Barcelona's reference academies for commercial styles.\n\nRecognized by CID UNESCO and directed by Yunaisy Farray (actress in Street Dance 2), the academy has been training dancers since 2012 with over 25 styles available. With a 4.9/5 Google rating and over 15,000 students trained, it combines professionalism with a welcoming, inclusive atmosphere.",

  "kizombaWhatIsP1": "Imagine a dance where the connection with your partner is so intense it feels like you're reading each other's minds. Where every movement comes from the embrace, not memorized steps. That's Kizomba: the most sensual dance from Africa, born in Angola in the late 80s and now conquering dance floors worldwide.",
  "kizombaWhatIsP2": "Kizomba was born from the fusion of Angolan Semba with Zouk from the French Antilles. The name means \"party\" in Kimbundu, one of the Bantu languages of Angola. Unlike other Latin dances, Kizomba is danced in a close embrace with undulating hip movements, where the leader guides with the torso, not the hands.",
  "kizombaWhatIsP3": "In our classes, we work on real partner connection, African musicality, and that smooth, controlled movement quality that makes Kizomba so special. It's not about learning complicated figures, but feeling the music and communicating with your partner through the embrace.",
  "kizombaWhatIsP4": "It doesn't matter if you come alone or with a partner, if you've never danced or already know other styles. Kizomba is for anyone seeking human connection, musicality, and an intimate, elegant way of dancing.",

  "kizombaCulturalShort": "Kizomba was born in Angola in the late 1980s, fusing traditional Semba with Antillean Zouk. From Luanda it spread to Portugal, France, and today is one of the most popular partner dances worldwide. At Farray's Center we teach authentic Kizomba with respect for its African roots.",
  "kizombaCulturalFull": "### Where does Kizomba come from?\n\n**Kizomba was born in Angola in the late 1980s**, primarily in Luanda, the capital. The name comes from Kimbundu, a Bantu language, and means \"party\" or \"celebration.\" It emerged when Angolan musicians began fusing **Semba** (Angola's traditional dance) with the electronic rhythms of **Zouk** from the French Antilles.\n\n### Semba: the root of everything\n\nBefore Kizomba, there was Semba, an Angolan partner dance characterized by quick hip movements and a close embrace. Semba has centuries of history and is considered one of the origins of Brazilian samba (when Angolan slaves were taken to Brazil).\n\nKizomba took the embrace and connection from Semba, but slowed it down and added the sensuality of Zouk music, creating something completely new.\n\n### Eduardo Paim and the pioneers\n\n**Eduardo Paim** is considered the father of modern Kizomba. In 1981, he began experimenting by fusing Semba with electronic rhythms. Other fundamental artists were:\n\n- **Bibi dos Santos**: Composer and producer who defined the classic sound\n- **Paulo Flores**: Brought Kizomba to new audiences\n- **Bonga**: Though better known for Semba, influenced the style's evolution\n\n### The expansion to Europe\n\nIn the 1990s, with Angola's independence and migrations, Kizomba arrived in **Portugal**, where it found a second home. Lisbon became the European epicenter of the dance. From there it spread to France, Spain, Germany, and the rest of the world.\n\nToday there are Kizomba festivals in more than 50 countries. In Barcelona, the scene has grown enormously in the last decade.\n\n### Styles within Kizomba\n\nWith globalization, Kizomba has evolved into several styles:\n\n- **Traditional Kizomba**: The original Angolan style, with emphasis on connection and musicality\n- **Urban Kiz**: A more modern version with hip hop influences and more technical movements\n- **Tarraxinha**: A slower, more sensual style, focused on hip movements\n- **Ghetto Zouk**: Fusion of Kizomba with R&B and Zouk, popular at parties\n\n### What is worked on in Kizomba classes?\n\n- **Embrace and connection**: The foundation of everything. Learning to lead and follow from the torso\n- **Ginga**: The basic hip movement characteristic of the style\n- **Musicality**: Interpreting the different instruments and layers of the music\n- **Saídas**: Figures and exits that add variety without losing connection\n- **Tarraxinha**: The slower, more sensual undulating movements\n\n### Kizomba in Barcelona\n\n**Farray's International Dance Center**, in the **Eixample district (Calle Entença 100, between Plaza España and Sants)**, offers Kizomba classes focused on authentic connection and respect for the African roots of the dance.\n\nRecognized by CID UNESCO and with more than 15,000 students trained, the academy combines professional technique with a welcoming atmosphere where you can truly learn to dance Kizomba.",
