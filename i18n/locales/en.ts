  philosophyBody1:
    'No effort will bring you more benefits than learning and practicing a dance. The endorphins you produce while dancing generate an immediate increase in serotonin, and with it, your level of well-being. When you dance, you smile more, you like yourself more, you are more sociable, more flexible, and more understanding. If there is one thing capable of changing your life from the very first moment, it is, without a doubt, dancing.',
  philosophyBody2:
    "More than a conventional dance school, what Yunaisy Farray and her team offer is a center that reflects their artistic ideals and way of life.

  dancehallFaqQ1: 'What exactly is dancehall?',
  dancehallFaqA1:
    "Dancehall is a style of music and dance that originated in Jamaica in the 70s. It's characterized by energetic movements, powerful rhythms ('riddims'), and a bold, confident attitude. It's much more than just steps: it's a complete cultural expression with its own history, music, and community. In our classes, you don't just learn the movements but also the culture and context behind them.",
  dancehallFaqQ2: 'Is dancehall difficult to learn?',
  dancehallFaqA2:
    'No more than any other dance style. Dancehall may seem intimidating at first due to its energy and rhythm, but our pedagogical approach breaks down each movement step by step. We start with the fundamentals (grooves, basic riddims) and advance gradually. Most of our beginner students are dancing full choreographies within a few weeks. The most important thing is attitude and the desire to have fun.',
  dancehallFaqQ3: 'Do I need to be in shape for dancehall classes?',
  dancehallFaqA3:
    "You don't need to be in specific shape to start. Dancehall itself is an excellent cardiovascular and endurance workout, so you'll improve your physical condition with each class. We work at different intensities and you can always adapt the movements to your current level. The important thing is to listen to your body and progress at your own pace.",
  dancehallFaqQ4: 'What should I wear to dancehall class?',
  dancehallFaqA4:
    "Comfortable, sporty clothing that allows you to move freely. Many students wear athletic pants or leggings and a t-shirt. For footwear, clean athletic shoes with good soles are ideal. Bring a water bottle because you're going to sweat! Optional: a small towel and your best attitude.",

  // Classes FAQ
  classesFaqQ1: "How many dance styles do you teach at Farray's Center?",
  classesFaqA1:
    'We offer training in over 25 different dance styles. Our catalog includes Latin dances (salsa, bachata, kizomba), urban dance (hip hop, dancehall, afrobeats, reggaeton), classical styles (ballet, contemporary, jazz), and specializations like physical preparation for dancers. This variety allows you to explore different styles and find those that resonate most with you, or specialize in one while complementing with others.',
  classesFaqQ2: 'Can I take classes in different styles at the same time?',
  classesFaqA2:
    'Of course! In fact, we recommend it. Learning multiple dance styles makes you a more complete and versatile dancer. For example, ballet improves your posture and technique for salsa, while hip hop can make your bachata more dynamic. Our class packages allow you to attend different types of classes according to your interests. Many of our most advanced students practice 3-4 styles simultaneously.',
  classesFaqQ3: 'How do I know which level is right for me?',
  classesFaqA3:
    "If it's your first class, we always recommend starting at the fundamentals or beginner level. However, if you have previous dance experience, our instructors can assess you in your first trial class and recommend the most appropriate level. You can also try an intermediate level class if you feel the fundamentals are too basic. The important thing is that you feel challenged but not overwhelmed.",
  classesFaqQ4: 'How often should I attend classes to see progress?',
  classesFaqA4:
    'For consistent and noticeable progress, we recommend attending at least twice a week. At this frequency, most students see significant improvements in 2-3 months. If you can attend 3-4 times a week, progress will be even faster. However, even a weekly class will allow you to advance, albeit at a more gradual pace. Consistency is more important than intensity.',
  classesFaqQ5: 'Do you offer private or only group classes?',
  classesFaqA5:
    "We offer both options. Group classes are excellent for learning in community, making friends, and benefiting from the group's energy. Private classes are ideal if you seek personalized attention, have specific goals (like preparing for a presentation or wedding), or prefer a more flexible schedule. Many students combine both: regular group classes supplemented with occasional private sessions to work on specific aspects.",

  dhV3CulturalTitle: 'Dancehall History and Culture',
  dhV3CulturalShort:
    'Dancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston (Jamaica) in the late 70s as an evolution of reggae, driven by sound systems in streets and dancehalls, community spaces to dance and release social tensions.',
  dhV3CulturalFull:
    "### The origins: Kingston, Jamaica (1970s–1980s)\n\nDancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 70s. It emerged as a natural evolution of reggae when sound systems (mobile sound systems) began taking music to the streets and dancehalls. The name \"dancehall\" comes from those spaces where the community gathered to dance, socialize, and express themselves. It was where social tensions were released through music and movement.\n\n### The legends: Bogle, Passa Passa, and the pioneers\n\n**Gerald \"Bogle\" Levy (1964–2005) is considered the father of modern Dancehall.** He created iconic moves like **Bogle, Row Di Boat, Log On, and Willie Bounce**, the foundation of the Dancehall vocabulary.\n\n**Passa Passa**, the legendary street dancehall sessions in Tivoli Gardens (Kingston), was the epicenter where new steps were born and dancers were consecrated.\n\nOther pioneers like **Ding Dong, Keiva, John Hype** and crews like **Ravers Clavers** took Dancehall international in the 2000s.\n\n**\"Gerald 'Bogle' Levy is the father of modern Dancehall with iconic steps like Bogle, Row Di Boat and Log On; Passa Passa in Tivoli Gardens (Kingston) was the street dancehall epicenter where trends were born.\"**\n\n### Global expansion (2000s–present)\n\nIn the 2000s, Dancehall exploded globally thanks to artists like **Sean Paul, Shaggy, Elephant Man, and Beenie Man**. Social media and YouTube popularized steps like **Dutty Wine, Daggering, and Nuh Linga**.\n\n**Since the 2000s, artists like Sean Paul and Elephant Man, along with YouTube and social media, globalized Dancehall with steps like Dutty Wine and Daggering; today it has strong communities in Europe (Barcelona as epicenter), Africa, Asia and America.**\n\nToday, Dancehall is a worldwide phenomenon with active communities in Europe, Africa, Asia, and America; Barcelona is one of its European epicenters.\n\n### The music: Riddims and Sound System culture\n\n**Dancehall is danced to riddims (instrumental bases) that producers create and multiple artists voice over.** Legendary riddims like **Diwali, Coolie Dance, or Dump Truck** defined entire eras.\n\n**\"Dancehall is danced to legendary riddims like Diwali or Coolie Dance, with sound system culture of selectors, MCs and rewinds; multiple artists voice over the same instrumental base, defining eras.\"**\n\nSound system culture—with its selectors, MCs, and the famous rewind when a song is so good it gets replayed from the start—is essential to understanding Dancehall.\n\n### More than dance: identity and resistance\n\nDancehall has always been a form of cultural resistance and identity expression for Jamaica's marginalized communities. It's the voice of the ghettos, a celebration of joy despite difficulties.\n\n**\"Dancehall is cultural resistance from Jamaican ghettos, with steps loaded with meaning like Log On ('connect') or Nuh Linga ('don't delay'), celebrating joy and identity despite difficulties.\"**\n\nEach step has meaning: **Log On** (connect), **Willie Bounce** (tribute to Willie Haggart), **Nuh Linga** (don't delay). Every movement tells a story.\n\n### Dancehall at Farray's: technique and community\n\nAt Farray's International Dance Center, Dancehall is taught with technique, respect and historical context, prioritizing good energy, movement precision and a professional environment.\n\n**Scientific studies on dance indicate that dancing improves coordination, proprioception and overall physical condition, as well as reducing stress and improving mood, and Dancehall benefits from these effects due to its high energy and complete body work.**\n\n**An active Dancehall class can burn 300-480 calories per hour depending on weight and intensity, similar to other high-demand aerobic dances.**\n\n**Scientific reviews associate regular dancing with lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia, highlighting its value as brain training in dynamic styles like Dancehall.**\n\n**Farray's International Dance Center offers Dancehall classes in a school rated close to 5/5 on Google with hundreds of positive reviews.**",

  // What is Urban Dance Section
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_title: 'What is Urban Dance?',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_definition:
    'Urban dances are dance styles born in the streets, plazas and neighborhoods of different cities around the world. They\'re called "urban" because they emerged outside theaters and academies: in the Bronx (Hip Hop), Jamaica (Dancehall), South Korea (K-Pop), Cuba (Reggaeton), Ghana and Nigeria (Afrobeat), and in nightclubs worldwide (Heels, Twerk, Sexy Style).',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_origin:
    'The term "urban dance" groups a huge family of styles that share common DNA: they were born from popular culture, transmitted by imitation in the streets and evolved with contemporary urban music (rap, reggae, dancehall, trap, afrobeats). Unlike classical dance (ballet, contemporary, jazz), urban dances prioritize groove, musicality, attitude and personal expression over academic technique.',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_difference_title:
    'Difference between "Urban Dance", "Street Dance" and "Commercial Dance"',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_difference_urban:
    'Urban Dance: Generic term for all dance styles born in urban and street contexts. Includes Hip Hop, Breaking, Popping, Locking, Krump, House, Dancehall, Afrobeat, etc.',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_difference_street:
    'Street Dance: Refers specifically to styles originally danced in the street and in battles (cyphers). E.g.: Breaking, Popping, Locking, Krump. These styles have battle codes, improvisation (freestyle) and competition.',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_difference_commercial:
    'Commercial Dance: Urban style choreographed and polished for the entertainment industry: music videos, concerts, TV shows. Mixes technique from different urban styles with elements of jazz, contemporary and commercial influences. E.g.: K-Pop choreographies, Heels, mainstream artist music videos.',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_why_many_styles:
    'So many different styles exist because each was born in a unique cultural, geographical and musical context. Hip Hop emerged in the Bronx, New York with rap culture and breakdancing. Dancehall was born in Jamaica with soundsystems and reggae music. K-Pop evolved in South Korea fusing Western pop with Asian aesthetics. Afrobeat connects with modern African rhythms from Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa. Each style tells a different story, has its own codes and is danced with distinct energy.',

  prepFisicaFaqQ3:
    'How many times per week should I train physical preparation if I already take dance classes?',
  prepFisicaFaqA3:
    'Ideal: 2-3 weekly sessions of 45-60 minutes. If you dance 4-5 times per week, 2 physical preparation sessions are enough to see significant improvements in strength, flexibility and injury prevention.',

  // FAQs optimized for AI search engines (10 questions)
  salsaBachataFaqQ1: "What styles of salsa and bachata are taught at Farray's Center Barcelona?",
  salsaBachataFaqA1:
    "At Farray's Center we teach Cuban Salsa, Sensual Bachata, Bachata Lady Style, Cuban Timba, Son Cubano, Salsa Lady Style, Salsa Lady Timba, Men Style and Cuban Folklore. Our teachers are graduates of the National School of Art of Cuba and have experience in Havana's best academies, guaranteeing authenticity and quality in every class.",

  salsaBachataFaqQ2: 'Do I need to bring a partner for salsa or bachata classes?',
  salsaBachataFaqA2:
    "No, you don't need to bring a partner. In our partner dance classes (salsa, bachata, timba) we constantly rotate so everyone has the opportunity to dance with different partners. This helps you develop your connection technique and feel comfortable dancing with anyone. We also offer individual Lady Style and Men Style classes if you prefer to focus on your personal technique.",

  salsaBachataFaqQ3: "What's the difference between Cuban Salsa and other salsa styles?",
  salsaBachataFaqA3:
    'Cuban Salsa is danced in a circle and has a more circular, joyful and "street" style compared to Salsa on Line (LA Style or NY Style). Cuban incorporates Afro-Cuban, son and rumba movements. It\'s very social: you can dance in rueda de casino (several dancers in a circle) or in pairs. At Farray\'s we teach authentic Cuban salsa with teachers from Havana.',

  salsaBachataFaqQ4: 'What level do I need to start salsa or bachata classes?',
  salsaBachataFaqA4:
    "None. We have classes for all levels: Beginner (you've never danced), Basic (you know the basic steps), Intermediate (you dance fluently and know figures) and Advanced (you master technique and musicality). If you've never danced salsa or bachata, start in our Beginner classes where we teach you from scratch: basic step, musical timing, partner connection and first figures.",

  salsaBachataFaqQ5: 'How long does it take to learn to dance salsa or bachata?',
  salsaBachataFaqA5:
    "It depends on your dedication, but with consistent practice (2-3 classes per week) you can dance confidently in 2-3 months. To master the technique, advanced musicality and complex figures, we recommend at least 6-12 months. Many of our advanced students have been perfecting their style for years and never stop learning. What's important is to enjoy the process from day one.",

  salsaBachataFaqQ6: "What's the difference between Sensual Bachata and Bachata Lady Style?",
  salsaBachataFaqA6:
    'Sensual Bachata is danced in pairs with connection, body waves, dips and isolations inspired by zouk and contemporary. Bachata Lady Style focuses on individual feminine dancing: footwork technique, hip movement, arms, waves and attitude, perfect for shining alone on the dance floor or perfecting your technique before partner dancing. Both complement each other: Sensual for connection, Lady Style for personal technique.',

  salsaBachataFaqQ7: 'Do salsa and bachata classes include live music?',
  salsaBachataFaqA7:
    "Our regular classes use recorded music from the best salsa and bachata artists (Celia Cruz, El Gran Combo, Marc Anthony, Romeo Santos, Prince Royce, etc.). However, we organize special events, Latin parties and workshops with live musicians where you can practice what you've learned in a festive and authentic atmosphere. We also collaborate with salsa festivals in Barcelona.",

  salsaBachataFaqQ8: 'Do you offer Rueda de Casino classes?',
  salsaBachataFaqA8:
    'Yes, Rueda de Casino is an integral part of our Cuban Salsa classes. Rueda is a modality where multiple couples dance in a circle and a "cantante" (caller) announces the figures that everyone executes at the same time. It\'s very fun, social and traditional in Cuba. To dance rueda you need to first master the basic steps of Cuban salsa and the main figures.',

  salsaBachataFaqQ9: 'Where is the salsa and bachata school located?',
  salsaBachataFaqA9:
    'We are at Calle Entença 100, 08015 Barcelona, just 5 minutes walk from Plaza España and Sants Station. Metro: L1 (Hostafrancs) / L3 (Tarragona, Plaza España). Train: Sants Estació. Buses: 13, 37, 65, 79, 109, 165. We have spacious, air-conditioned rooms with special dance flooring.',

  // Point 1 - What is Salsa y Bachata Section
  salsaBachata_whatIs_title: 'What is Salsa Cubana and Bachata?',
  salsaBachata_whatIs_salsa:
    "Salsa Cubana is much more than a dance: it's a cultural expression born in Cuba that fuses Afro-Caribbean rhythms (son, rumba, mambo, cha-cha-cha) with jazz and other styles. It's characterized by circular movements in pairs (rueda de casino), quick footwork, free body expression and a deep connection with the music. It's the most social and festive salsa style, perfect for group dancing and enjoying improvisation.",
  salsaBachata_whatIs_bachata:
    "Bachata is a sensual and romantic dance originating from the Dominican Republic. It was born in working-class neighborhoods in the 1960s and evolved to become one of the most popular Latin dances in the world. It's danced in pairs with marked hip movements, simple basic steps (side-to-side with tap) and fluid turns. There are several styles: Dominican Bachata (traditional), Sensual Bachata (modern, with body waves) and Bachata Fusion.",
  salsaBachata_whatIs_difference_title: 'Difference between Salsa Cubana and Salsa on Line',
  salsaBachata_whatIs_difference_text:
    'Salsa Cubana is danced in a circle (rueda de casino), with freer and more Afro-Caribbean movements, ideal for parties and social dancing. Salsa on Line (LA or New York style) is danced in a straight line, with more technical choreographies and spectacular turns, perfect for shows and exhibitions. Both styles share the same music, but the dancing philosophy is different.',
  salsaBachata_whatIs_benefits:
    "Dancing Salsa and Bachata improves your coordination, rhythm, cardiovascular fitness, social confidence and cultural connection. It's a fun way to exercise, meet new people and immerse yourself in Latin culture. Additionally, you develop musicality, body expression and leadership/following skills in partnership.",

  faq_reservas_4_q: 'Is class booking mandatory? Who should manage bookings?',
  faq_reservas_4_a:
    '<p>Of course. All cancellations and bookings must be managed by each student through the mobile app or desktop environment. We have invested many resources to set up a perfect system so that everyone can do it on their own and we do not manage bookings manually, whether at reception, by phone, email or WhatsApp.</p><p class="mt-3">Our goal is to focus on giving you better customer service, instead of wasting time on cumbersome administrative processes that don\'t contribute to the academy\'s growth.</p>',

  faq_reservas_6_q: 'If I cancel a class, can I make it up later?',
  faq_reservas_6_a:
    '<p>If you have a membership and cancel a class and then want to make it up, keep in mind that you have <strong>30 DAYS TO DO SO</strong>, counting from the date of the canceled class.</p><p class="mt-3">If you have a class pack, you are the one who manages your classes flexibly and you only need to cancel your class and book it for another day when you wish, before the expiration period ends.</p><p class="mt-3">You can make up classes as long as the following points are respected:</p><ol class="mt-2 ml-6 space-y-2"><li><strong>1.</strong> You must be the one to manage the class cancellation from your Momence account (<a href="https://momence.com/sign-in?hostId=36148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary-accent hover:underline">https://momence.com/sign-in?hostId=36148</a>) or from the app. Yes or Yes.

Otherwise the system will register a late cancellation which is the same as if you had done the class, and it will not be returned in any case. It is important that you understand this point, because if you don\'t cancel your class with the proper time, you don\'t give us the opportunity to fill your spot with another person and that is not sustainable for the academy.</li><li><strong>3.</strong> Once you cancel the class you must be the one to book it for another day. You can choose a different class from the one you usually do, always respecting the course level.</li></ol><p class="mt-3"><strong>IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND:</strong></p><ul class="mt-2 ml-6 space-y-1 list-disc"><li>Classes can only be made up occasionally. If you start missing recurrently and making improper use of the system, your monthly subscription will be canceled and you will be invited to purchase the class pack rate that allows you to have the flexibility you need.</li><li>Keep in mind that missing a class does not exempt the corresponding monthly payment day from being the same.</li><li>If you miss a class, that class credit will remain in your account and you have 30 DAYS TO USE IT, otherwise it will DISAPPEAR forever and WILL NOT BE REFUNDED in any case.</li><li>In no case will classes accumulate for the following months. If class credits are not used in the due period, they do not accumulate and will disappear.</li><li>Classes must be canceled with a minimum notice of 2 hours. Otherwise the system will register a late cancellation which is the same as if you had done the class, and it will not be returned in any case. This point applies to both memberships and class packs.</li><li>Only students with an active membership/pack at the school will be able to make up classes.

  twerkCulturalHistoryTitle: 'Want to know more about Twerk?',
  twerkCulturalShort:
    "Twerk is an urban dance style characterized by rhythmic hip and glute movements, originating from New Orleans bounce culture (USA) in the late 1980s. It combines influences from Afro-descendant dances like the mapouka from Ivory Coast and Afro-Caribbean traditions. In Barcelona, Farray's International Dance Center (Entença 100, Eixample) has been a reference for Twerk instruction since 2012.",
  twerkCulturalFull:
    '### Definition: What is Twerk?\n\n**Twerk is an urban dance style characterized by rhythmic, isolated movements of the hips, pelvis and glutes, executed with muscular control and coordination over urban music bases.** Born in the New Orleans bounce scene (Louisiana, USA) between 1989 and 1993, Twerk fuses influences from traditional West African dances —such as the mapouka from Ivory Coast— with African-American hip hop culture from the southern United States.\n\n### The Origins: Africa, Caribbean and the Southern U.S.\n\nTwerk didn\'t appear overnight. It was born from a mix of Afro-descendant influences: movements from traditional African dances like "mapouka" (West Africa), from New Orleans bounce culture and other urban styles that already worked a lot on the hips and the "booty".\n\nBefore Instagram existed and before anyone labeled it "twerk", there were already women (and men) moving their hips and glutes in African and Caribbean dances, linked to rituals, celebrations and popular festivals. With the arrival of these peoples to the United States, that body memory mixed with new music and contexts. In the south of the country, especially in New Orleans, that mix exploded.\n\n### New Orleans Bounce (1989-1993): Where Twerk Gets Its Name and Attitude\n\nModern Twerk as we know it is closely linked to **New Orleans Bounce**, a hip hop subgenre born in the late 80s and early 90s. In the clubs and block parties of the city, the audience —especially Black women— began to develop a dance style focused on glute, leg and pelvis work, with lots of energy, endurance and attitude.\n\nArtists like **DJ Jubilee** (author of "Do the Jubilee All", 1993), **Big Freedia** and **Cheeky Blakk** helped popularize that sound and those movements. That\'s where Twerk stops being "just another step" and becomes its own style: physical, explosive and unapologetically free.\n\n### Physical Benefits of Twerk\n\nAccording to scientific literature on physical activity and dance:\n\n- **Caloric expenditure:** A moderate-to-high intensity dance session can burn between 300 and 600 kcal/hour depending on body weight, intensity and duration (American Council on Exercise).\n- **Muscle strengthening:** Twerk specifically works the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, quadriceps, hamstrings and core, contributing to lower body toning.\n- **Coordination and proprioception:** Regular dance practice improves motor coordination and body awareness.\n- **Mental health:** Studies published in *Frontiers in Psychology* (2021) associate regular dance practice with reduced anxiety symptoms and improved mood.\n\n### From the Clubs to the World: Global Expansion of Twerk\n\nFrom the 2000s, with the power of music videos and, later, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, Twerk went global. It appeared in mainstream artist videos, on tours of major pop stars and on stages around the world.\n\n**Since the 2000s, driven by music videos and social media, Twerk went from being a dance linked to clubs and block parties in the southern U.S. to a global phenomenon present in mainstream videos, dance schools, battles and workshops in Europe and Latin America.**\n\nIn Europe and Latin America it crossed with other styles like Dancehall, Reggaeton and Hip Hop, and Twerk schools, battles and workshops started popping up everywhere. Today, Twerk is no longer "just a trend": it has technique, schools, competitions and its own pedagogy.\n\n### The Music of Twerk: Bounce, Hip Hop, Trap and More\n\n**Although Twerk is strongly linked to New Orleans bounce, today it\'s also danced to hip hop, trap, dancehall, afrobeats, reggaeton and other urban rhythms, always seeking a marked beat and pumping sensation that facilitates bounces and rhythm changes.**\n\nEach beat invites a different type of energy: more aggressive, more sensual or more festive.\n\n### Much More Than Moving Your Glutes: Body, Identity and Power\n\nReducing Twerk to "moving your butt" is to understand absolutely nothing. **In the context of professional schools, Twerk is taught as comprehensive training: body awareness, leg, core and glute strength, coordination, self-esteem and empowerment, helping students reconcile with their body and decide how they want to show themselves.**\n\nTwerk, as we teach it at Farray\'s, is about: **body awareness** (learning to isolate, control and protect your body), **physical strength** (strong legs, core and glutes; endurance and coordination), **identity and self-esteem** (reconciling with your body, your shape, your rhythm and your desire), and **empowerment** (deciding how you move, how you show yourself and what story your dance tells).\n\n### Twerk Classes in Barcelona: Farray\'s International Dance Center\n\n**Farray\'s International Dance Center**, located at **Calle Entença 100, Eixample district, Barcelona (08015)**, has been offering Twerk classes since 2012. The academy is recognized by **CID UNESCO** (International Dance Council) and directed by **Yunaisy Farray**, professional dancer and actress in the film *Street Dance 2* (2012).\n\n**Verifiable academy data:**\n- **Address:** Calle Entença 100, 08015 Barcelona, Spain\n- **Access:** Metro L1/L3 (Plaça Espanya), L5 (Entença), Rodalies (Barcelona-Sants)\n- **Google Rating:** 4.9/5 with over 500 verified reviews\n- **Recognition:** CID UNESCO member\n- **Twerk Schedule:** Classes Monday through Friday at beginner, basic and intermediate levels\n\nTwerk is taught at Farray\'s with technique, respect and historical context: it\'s not a spectacle for filming "attention-grabbing" videos, but a tool for gaining strength, confidence and stage presence, in a professional, inclusive environment close to Barcelona\'s best transport connections.',

  afroCulturalShort:
    'Afrobeats emerged in the late 90s in Nigeria and Ghana as an urban fusion of African rhythms, highlife, hip hop, R&B and dancehall, creating marked percussion and global melodies.',
  afroCulturalFull: `### Origins: Lagos, Accra and the New African Wave

Afrobeats (plural) emerged in the late 90s and early 2000s between Nigeria and Ghana. It is not a single genre, but an urban current that mixes African rhythms with highlife, hip hop, R&B, dancehall and pop. The result is a recognizable sound: marked percussion, powerful bass, catchy melodies and unforgettable choruses.

**"Afrobeats emerged in the late 90s in Nigeria and Ghana as an urban fusion of African rhythms, highlife, hip hop, R&B and dancehall, creating marked percussion and global melodies."**

### From Fela Kuti to Current Afrobeats

Before this modern wave, in the 60s and 70s, Fela Kuti revolutionized Nigerian music originating Afrobeat (singular): a fusion of jazz, funk, highlife and Yoruba rhythms with messages of social and political protest, extended songs and immersive instrumental structures. Current Afrobeats takes rhythmic elements from Afrobeat, but adapts them to shorter songs, digital production and an orientation to international consumption for radio and clubs.

**"From Fela Kuti's Afrobeat (60-70s, jazz-funk-protest) to modern Afrobeats: short songs, digital production and global focus, maintaining Yoruba and Nigerian highlife rhythms."**

### From Sound to Movement: Afrodance

The musical rise of Afrobeats brought new dance forms: what is now defined as Afrodance or afro urban dances. These movements were born in streets and clubs of Lagos, Accra or Johannesburg, and some viral examples have been:

• **Azonto** (Ghana): hips, shoulders and everyday gestures.
• **Etighi, Shoki, Shaku Shaku, Zanku/Legwork** (Nigeria): intense footwork, knee bounce and relaxed arms.

These dances go viral globally through YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. Additionally, from Gabon has recently emerged **Ntcham or Tcham Bolo**, a musical and urban dance expression originating in the popular neighborhoods and prisons of Libreville.

**"Afrodance includes Azonto (Ghana: hips-gestures), Shaku Shaku/Zanku (Nigeria: feet-bounce), and Ntcham (Gabon: urban roots), viralized by YouTube, TikTok and Instagram from the streets of Lagos and Accra."**

### Global Expansion: From Lagos to Barcelona

Since the 2000s, artists like **Wizkid, Davido, Tiwa Savage and Burna Boy** have taken Afrobeats out of Africa, collaborating with international pop and rap stars. Festivals, clubs and digital platforms have transformed this genre into a symbol of new African culture, influencing music, dance, fashion and attitude worldwide. In cities like Barcelona, the Afrodance community is growing rapidly.

**"Artists like Wizkid, Davido and Burna Boy globalized Afrobeats since the 2000s with pop/rap collaborations; it influences festivals, clubs and cities like Barcelona, symbol of modern African culture."**

### More than a Trend: Identity and Community

Although Afrodance may be seen a lot on social media, its root is deep: it is a manifestation of pride, joy, humor, sensuality and African feeling. Each step breathes intention: play, power, enjoyment. Afrobeats and Afrodance connect with the basic instinct to move, share energy, and feel part of a global identity, even if you are far from Lagos or Accra.

**"Afrobeats/Afrodance express African pride, joy, sensuality and global community; each step carries intention of play, power and connection, beyond social media."**

  hhrCulturalShort:
    'Hip Hop Reggaeton fuses two iconic cultural movements: hip-hop born in the Bronx of New York in 1973 and reggaeton emerging from Puerto Rico in the early 1990s. This fusion represents the natural evolution of contemporary urban dance.',
  hhrCulturalFull: `### The Origins of Hip Hop: South Bronx, New York (1973)

**On August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc hosted a party at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the South Bronx, New York, considered the official birth of Hip Hop.** Clive Campbell (DJ Kool Herc), a Jamaican immigrant, introduced the technique of isolating and extending the instrumental "breaks" from funk and soul records, creating a new sound that invited dancing.

**"Hip Hop was born on August 11, 1973, in the South Bronx of New York, when DJ Kool Herc isolated funk record breaks at a party at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue."**

African-American and Latino communities in the Bronx developed the **four fundamental pillars of Hip Hop**: DJing (turntablism), MCing (rap), B-boying/B-girling (breaking), and Graffiti (visual urban art).

### Hip Hop Dance Pioneers

Legendary groups established the techniques that define Hip Hop dance today:

- **The Lockers (1973)**: Don Campbell created Locking in Los Angeles
- **Electric Boogaloos (1977)**: Boogaloo Sam developed Popping in Fresno, California
- **The Rock Steady Crew (1977)**: Breaking pioneers in the Bronx

**"The Rock Steady Crew (1977) and Electric Boogaloos (1977) established the technical foundations of breaking and popping taught in academies worldwide today."**

**At the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, breaking was included as an official Olympic discipline**, recognizing over 50 years of technical and artistic development in Hip Hop.

### Reggaeton: From Puerto Rico to the World (1990s)

**Reggaeton emerged in Puerto Rico in the early 1990s, fusing Jamaican reggae, American hip-hop, and Latin rhythms.** Producers like DJ Playero and artists like Vico C were pioneers of the Puerto Rican "underground" movement.

**The characteristic "dembow" rhythm comes from the track "Dem Bow" (1990) by Jamaican artist Shabba Ranks**, produced by Bobby "Digital" Dixon. This rhythmic pattern became the foundation of reggaeton.

**"The reggaeton dembow rhythm comes from the track Dem Bow (1990) by Shabba Ranks; Daddy Yankee popularized it globally with Gasolina (2004)."**

**In 2004, "Gasolina" by Daddy Yankee marked the international breakthrough of reggaeton.** Artists like Don Omar, Tego Calderón, Wisin & Yandel, and Ivy Queen consolidated the genre on the world stage.

**"Despacito" (2017) by Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee** became the first video to reach 7 billion views on YouTube, demonstrating reggaeton's global reach.

### The Hip Hop Reggaeton Fusion

The fusion of Hip Hop and Reggaeton represents the natural evolution of both genres. Contemporary artists like Bad Bunny, J Balvin, and Rosalía combine elements of both styles, creating a hybrid sound that dominates global charts.

**"Hip Hop Reggaeton fusion combines the technique and swagger of hip-hop with the sensuality and rhythm of reggaeton, representing the evolution of 21st-century urban dance."**

This fusion incorporates:
- **From Hip Hop**: Grooves, bounces, isolations, footwork, and attitude
- **From Reggaeton**: Hip movement, dembow, sensuality, and Latin flow

### Barcelona: European Urban Dance Hub

**Barcelona has established itself as one of the main urban dance centers in Europe.** The city attracts dancers from across the continent for its vibrant cultural scene and climate that favors outdoor life.

**Farray's International Dance Center, located in the Eixample district (Calle Entença 100, Barcelona)**, offers Hip Hop Reggaeton classes at an academy accredited by the CID-UNESCO (International Dance Council of UNESCO in Paris).

### Physical and Mental Benefits

**Scientific studies on dance demonstrate that dancing improves coordination, proprioception, and cardiovascular condition, as well as reducing stress and improving mood.**

**A 60-minute Hip Hop Reggaeton class can burn between 400-600 calories**, depending on intensity and body weight, similar to other high-demand aerobic exercises.

**Farray's International Dance Center maintains a rating close to 5/5 on Google with hundreds of positive reviews**, establishing itself as a reference for urban dance in Barcelona.`,

  // Cultural History Section
  rcbCulturalHistoryTitle: 'History and Origins of Cuban Reggaeton',
  rcbCulturalShort:
    'Cuban reggaeton has its roots in the neighborhoods of Havana, where the fusion of Jamaican reggae with Afro-Cuban rhythms created a unique street style.',
  rcbCulturalFull: `### Origins: The Neighborhoods of Havana (1990s-2000s)

**Cuban Reggaeton (also known as Cubatón or Reparto) emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s in working-class neighborhoods of Havana like La Lisa, Marianao, Centro Habana and El Cerro.** It was born from the fusion of Puerto Rican reggaeton arriving by radio with traditional Afro-Cuban rhythms: rumba, Cuban son and Yoruba elements.

**"Cuban Reggaeton fuses Puerto Rican reggaeton with rumba, son and Yoruba rhythms, creating a unique style born in the neighborhoods of Havana."**

### Pioneer Artists

**Artists like Candyman, El Taiger, Chocolate MC, Osmani García and El Chacal popularized the genre** and defined its characteristic sound: dembow bases combined with Afro-Cuban percussion, street lyrics and a rebellious attitude reflecting everyday life in Cuban neighborhoods.

### Reparto: The Neighborhood Style

**The term "Reparto" comes from the "repartos" or working-class neighborhoods of Havana where this style was born.** It's characterized by rawer rhythms than commercial reggaeton, with a more direct and visceral connection to the music. Reparto dancers are recognized worldwide for their improvisation skills and technical mastery.

**"Reparto is characterized by raw rhythms, street lyrics and a rebellious attitude reflecting life in Cuban neighborhoods."**

### Distinctive Dance Techniques

Cuban Reggaeton dance is distinguished by unique technical elements:
- **Constant improvisation**: instant response to music changes
- **Advanced body dissociation**: hips, chest and shoulders moving independently
- **Tembleque**: rapid controlled hip vibration, exclusive Cuban technique
- **Floor movements**: inspired by Afro-Cuban rumba (guaguancó, columbia)
- **Cuban perreo**: more technical and rhythmic variant than Puerto Rican

**"Cuban Reggaeton dance is distinguished by improvisation, body dissociation, tembleque and floor movements inspired by Afro-Cuban rumba."**

### Afro-Cuban Influences

**Cuban Reggaeton incorporates elements of rumba (guaguancó, columbia), Cuban son and Yoruba dances, creating a unique style that differentiates it from Puerto Rican reggaeton.** This fusion of African and Caribbean traditions gives it its characteristic flavor and richness of movements.

### Cubatón Today: International Expansion

Today, Cubatón has expanded internationally while maintaining its essence: improvisation, flavor and that unique energy that only comes from Cuba. Artists like **El Taiger, Jacob Forever and Chocolate MC** have taken the Cuban sound worldwide, and with it, their way of dancing.

### Health Benefits

**A Cuban Reggaeton class can burn between 350 and 550 calories per hour** due to the intensity of tembleque and body dissociation movements. It also improves coordination, hip flexibility and rhythmic connection.

### Cuban Reggaeton at Farray's Center

**Farray's International Dance Center teaches authentic Cuban Reggaeton with Cuban teachers trained at the National School of Art (ENA) in Havana.** Classes maintain the street essence of the style while offering structured technical progression for all levels.`,

  femCulturalShort:
    'Femmology is a unique discipline created by Yunaisy Farray in Barcelona, blending heels dancing, dance therapy and feminine expression. Internationally recognised by CID-UNESCO, it has become a global reference for female empowerment through movement.',
  femCulturalFull: `### Origin and History of Femmology

Femmology was born in Barcelona from the vision of Yunaisy Farray, a Cuban professional dancer trained at the prestigious National School of Art of Cuba (ENA). Following an international career that includes her role as an actress in the film Street Dance 2 (2012), Yunaisy developed this unique methodology that transcends the traditional concept of heels dancing.

The discipline emerges from the integration of three fields: professional dance technique, dance therapy principles, and the study of feminine body expression. This innovative fusion has positioned Femmology as an internationally recognised practice, with Farray's International Dance Center being an official member of the International Dance Council (CID-UNESCO).

### Methodology and Foundations

The term "Femmology" combines "femme" (woman in French) with the suffix "-ology" (the study of), literally defining "the study of femininity". The methodology is structured around three fundamental pillars:

- **Body technique**: Development of posture, dissociation, muscular control and coordination specific to movement in heels.
- **Emotional expression**: Application of dance therapy principles to release physical blockages and reconnect with emotions through conscious movement.
- **Personal empowerment**: Cultivation of confidence, stage presence and self-esteem through progressive body mastery.

### Femmology in Barcelona: World Headquarters

Barcelona has established itself as the world centre of Femmology. In the heart of Eixample, Farray's International Dance Center offers the only official programme of this discipline, where Yunaisy Farray personally directs the training. Students from across Europe travel to Barcelona to train in this exclusive methodology.

The philosophy of Femmology is distinguished by its focus on internal empowerment: it's not about "dancing for others", but about "feeling powerful for oneself". Each session creates a safe space where women explore their femininity without judgement, developing elegance and sensuality from a place of self-respect.

Over more than a decade, Femmology has transformed the lives of thousands of women, establishing itself as a pioneering discipline in Barcelona and an international reference in the field of therapeutic dance and female empowerment.`,

**Sexy Style is not a dance of outward seduction, but a practice of internal connection that uses sensuality as a path to inhabit the body with more presence.** Through the work of isolations, body lines, use of hips, torso, and gaze, Sexy Style invites you to feel like the protagonist, without needing to fit into a specific physical stereotype.

**"Sexy Style = internal connection + body presence; isolations, lines, hips, torso and gaze to feel like the protagonist."**

### The Female Empowerment Revolution

**In recent years, Sexy Style has experienced a boom thanks to artists like Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Doja Cat, and a whole generation of women who have claimed their right to express their sensuality without being sexualized or judged.** Current classes translate that imagery from music videos and tours into a safe space to work on self-esteem, stage attitude, and personal confidence, using the body as a tool for liberation and not as an object.

**"Sexy Style (2020s): female empowerment boom; Beyoncé, Rihanna, Doja Cat; the body as a tool for liberation."**

### From Show Dance to Everyday Empowerment

**This movement has turned what was once just "show dancing" into a path for everyday empowerment.** Many students use Sexy Style to reconcile with their body, improve their posture, and discover a way of moving that feels authentic and their own. Commercial technique and emotional expression intertwine to build a stronger identity on and off the dance floor.

**"Sexy Style transforms: from show dance to everyday empowerment; body reconciliation + posture + authentic movement."**

### Sexy Style Technique: Heels, Isolations and Attitude

**Sexy Style works a unique combination of technical and expressive skills.** The fundamental elements include:

- **Heels work**: balance, walking, turns and transitions
- **Isolations**: independent control of hips, torso, shoulders and head
- **Musicality**: interpretation of nuances, pauses and accents
- **Stage attitude**: presence, gaze and confidence projection

**"Sexy Style technique: heels + isolations + musicality + attitude; unique combination of physical and expressive skills."**

### Sexy Style in Barcelona: Farray's Center

**Farray's Center was one of the first academies in Barcelona to offer Sexy Style classes with a professional methodology, integrating commercial roots (music videos, tours, heels work) with the personal empowerment approach.** Under the direction of Yasmina Fernández, a program has been developed that combines technique (balance, walking in heels, isolations, musicality) with attitude and stage presence work.

**"Farray's Center Barcelona: pioneers in professional Sexy Style; methodology integrating commercial technique + personal empowerment."**

### Benefits of Sexy Style

**Practicing Sexy Style develops multiple physical and emotional capabilities that transcend dance.** It improves body posture, strengthens stabilizing muscles (especially core and legs), increases coordination and proprioception. On an emotional level, it reinforces self-esteem, reduces social anxiety, and develops a more positive relationship with one's own body.

**"Sexy Style develops: posture + core + coordination + self-esteem + body confidence; comprehensive physical and emotional transformation."**

### A Safe Space for All

**Today, Sexy Style at Farray's is experienced as a space for technical learning and a self-confidence laboratory where each student can build their own version of what it means to be sensual, strong, and free.** There are no perfect bodies or age limits: just women who decide to reconnect with their personal power through movement.

**"Farray's Center: safe space for all; no perfect bodies or age limits; reconnection with personal power."**`,

  // Cultural Section
  sxrCulturalHistoryTitle: 'History and Origin of Sexy Reggaeton',
  sxrCulturalShort:
    'Reggaeton was born in the 90s between Panama and Puerto Rico, emerging from the mix of Jamaican reggae, American hip hop and Caribbean Latin rhythms.',
  sxrCulturalFull: `### Origin of Reggaeton

Reggaeton emerged in Panama in the late 1980s with "reggae en español", popularized by artists like El General. In the 1990s, Puerto Rico adopted and transformed the genre, where producers like DJ Playero and DJ Nelson created the characteristic "dembow" rhythm that defines modern reggaeton.

The term "reggaeton" was consolidated in Puerto Rico around 1994-1995. Daddy Yankee, Tego Calderón and Don Omar were pioneers who took the genre from underground to international fame in the 2000s.

### Evolution to Sexy Reggaeton

Sexy Reggaeton is a specialization of classic Puerto Rican perreo, focused on feminine technique and expression. It combines elements of reggaeton, Jamaican dancehall and American twerk, developing movements such as body rolls, body isolation and controlled drops.

### Fundamental techniques

- **Body roll**: fluid wave of the torso from chest to hips.
- **Perreo**: circular and descending hip movements characteristic of the genre.
- **Body isolation**: independent control of hips, torso and limbs.
- **Drops**: controlled floor drops requiring strength and coordination.

### Reggaeton in Spain

Spain was one of the first European countries to adopt reggaeton. In Barcelona, the Latin urban scene grew significantly since 2005, driven by the Latin American community and local artists.

Rosalía, born in Sant Esteve Sesrovires (Barcelona), fused reggaeton with flamenco in hits like "Malamente" (2018) and "Con Altura" (2019), gaining international recognition and two Latin Grammy Awards.

### Reference artists

Daddy Yankee (Puerto Rico), Bad Bunny (Puerto Rico), Karol G (Colombia), J Balvin (Colombia), Anitta (Brazil) and Rosalía (Spain) have defined the current reggaeton aesthetic, with choreographies celebrating sensual movement and empowerment.`,

  // Cultural Section
  modernjazzCulturalShort:
    'Modern Jazz is born from the fusion of classical ballet with American jazz and modern dance, creating a unique style that combines academic technique with free expression.',
  modernjazzCulturalFull: `### Origins of Modern Jazz

Modern Jazz emerged in the United States during the 20th century, when dancers and choreographers began fusing classical ballet technique with the rhythmic energy of jazz and the expressiveness of modern dance. Pioneers like Jack Cole, Matt Mattox and Luigi developed the foundations of what we know today as Modern Jazz.

This dance takes from ballet the posture, clean lines, turns and jumps; from jazz, the musicality, groove and attitude; and from modern dance, the freedom of movement, floor work and emotional expression.

### The evolution of the style

Modern Jazz has constantly evolved, incorporating influences from hip hop, contemporary dance and commercial styles. Choreographers like Bob Fosse revolutionized the genre with his characteristic style of isolations, angular movements and contained sensuality.

Today, Modern Jazz is characterized by its versatility: from lyrical and emotional pieces to energetic and dynamic choreographies. It's the style you see in Broadway musicals, dance movies and the most acclaimed shows in the world.

### Modern Jazz in Barcelona

Farray's Center offers Modern Jazz classes under the direction of Alejandro Miñoso, a teacher with classical and contemporary training who combines technical demands with a friendly and motivating environment. Classes work on base technique, musicality, body expression and interpretation, preparing students for both the stage and enjoying dance.

### Scientific Benefits of Dancing Modern Jazz

Scientific studies show that dancing (like Modern Jazz) improves coordination, flexibility and significantly reduces stress, being as effective for body and mind as many gym workouts.

**One hour of intense dance can burn between 300 and 800 calories**, similar to running at a moderate pace, but with music, expression and much more fun.

A famous study published in the **New England Journal of Medicine** showed that people who danced frequently had up to **76% lower risk of developing dementia**.

Farray's International Dance Center is rated close to **5/5 on Google**, with hundreds of reviews placing it among the best-rated dance centers in Barcelona.`,

  balletWhatIsP1:
    'Classical ballet is more than a dance style; it is a discipline that strengthens your body and mind, and improves your overall well-being. Beyond training professional dancers, ballet offers accessible benefits for everyone, from improving posture and balance to enhancing concentration and memory.',
  balletWhatIsP2:
    'Since the late 17th century, Pierre Beauchamp established the five basic foot positions that still constitute the universal language of ballet today. Although born in Italy, it was in France where this technique took its definitive form, which is why we use terms like plié, tendu and jeté to name its most recognized movements.',
  balletWhatIsP3:
    "At Farray's, we fuse classical technique with the explosive power of the Cuban ballet school, which trained Carlos Acosta –considered for decades one of the best dancers in the world, compared to Nureyev and Baryshnikov for his aerial virtuosity–. This unique methodology brings athletic strength, expressiveness and musicality that enhance any dance, from hip hop and afrobeat to flamenco or contemporary dance, making ballet the essential technical foundation for complete dancers.",
  balletWhatIsP4:
    'Practicing ballet improves motor coordination, flexibility, muscular strength, balance and body awareness, facilitating the technical development of any dancer and promoting a healthy and disciplined lifestyle for those who simply seek well-being and bodily expression.',

  // ===== Cultural History =====
  balletCulturalHistoryTitle: 'Want to learn more about ballet?',
  balletCulturalShort:
    'Ballet was born in the Italian Renaissance courts and perfected in France under Louis XIV, who founded the first formal school dedicated to professional dance in 1661. This discipline has withstood wars, revolutions and social changes because it offers something unique: the complete transformation of the human being through movement.',
  balletCulturalFull: `### Definition of Classical Ballet

**Classical ballet is a highly technical form of theatrical dance with French vocabulary based on fundamental principles such as turnout (external rotation of legs), the five positions codified by Pierre Beauchamp in 1700, and pointe work.** It is the foundation of almost all dance disciplines and requires years of systematic training.

**"Classical Ballet: technical theatrical dance, French vocabulary, turnout, 5 positions (Beauchamp, 1700), pointe work."**

### Origins of Ballet: From Courts to Stage

**Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts (15th century), was codified in France under Louis XIV who founded the Académie Royale de Danse in 1661, and reached its technical peak in Russia with Marius Petipa and Tchaikovsky's ballets** (Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, The Nutcracker).

When Catherine de Medici married Henry II of France, she brought this tradition to the French court, marking the beginning of a new cultural era in Europe.

**"Ballet (1661, Louis XIV): Académie Royale de Danse. Peak in Russia: Petipa + Tchaikovsky."**

### The French Golden Age

In 1661, Louis XIV—known as "the Sun King" for his leading role in the Ballet de la Nuit—founded the Académie Royale de Danse, the first institution to formally codify and teach dance. His master, **Pierre Beauchamp, established the five fundamental foot positions** that remain the universal technical foundation of classical ballet.

### Fundamental Ballet Techniques

**Fundamental ballet techniques include: barre work (pliés, tendus, dégagés, battements), center work (adagio, pirouettes, allegro), jumps (petit allegro, grand allegro), and pointe work for advanced level.** The technique requires muscular control, flexibility and millimetric precision.

Why has ballet endured for over 300 years? Because it develops:

- **Perfect body alignment**: every movement starts from a strong, balanced center
- **Spatial awareness**: exact knowledge of every part of the body in space
- **Deep muscle control**: strength from stabilizing muscles
- **Grace under pressure**: the ability to make the difficult look easy

**"Ballet technique: barre + center + allegro + pointe. Requires control, flexibility, precision."**

### The Cuban School of Ballet at Farray's

**The Cuban School of Ballet, founded by Alicia Alonso in 1948, is distinguished by its technical virtuosity, dramatic expressiveness and adaptation of classical technique to the Latin physique.** Cuban dancers like Carlos Acosta, Lorena Feijóo and José Manuel Carreño have shone in the world's leading companies.

**At Farray's Center, ballet classes follow the tradition of the Cuban School of Ballet**, world-renowned for combining Russian technique with Latin expressiveness. **Alejandro Miñoso, trained at ENA (Cuba's National School of Art) and former soloist with Carlos Acosta's company**, transmits this unique methodology.

**"Cuban School (Alicia Alonso, 1948): Russian technique + Latin expressiveness. At Farray's: ENA-Cuba methodology."**

### Scientific Benefits of Ballet

Studies published in journals like *Journal of Dance Medicine & Science* show that **a ballet class burns between 300 and 400 calories and tones all muscle groups**, especially core, legs and glutes. Additionally, ballet:

- Improves bone density and helps prevent osteoporosis
- Increases flexibility and joint range of motion
- Develops proprioception and body awareness
- Reduces stress and anxiety
- Improves posture and relieves back pain

**"Ballet: 300-400 calories/class. Journal of Dance Medicine & Science: improves bone density."**

### Ballet Today: For Everyone Without Distinction

The stigma that "ballet is for girls" has become obsolete. Male dancers like Roberto Bolle, Sergei Polunin and Carlos Acosta have shown that ballet requires extraordinary strength and athleticism. At Farray's, men and women of all ages discover that ballet is the best training for any dance style.

**Ballet's legacy lives on in every dancer who learns the five positions, in every Nutcracker production at Christmas, and in the technical foundation of virtually all modern dance styles.** It is UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage and continues evolving in the 21st century.

### Ballet Vocabulary

All ballet terms are in French, a legacy of its development at the court of Versailles:

- **Plié**: bending the knees while keeping the back straight
- **Tendu**: stretching the leg while keeping the toe on the floor
- **Jeté**: jump from one leg to another
- **Pirouette**: turn on one leg
- **Arabesque**: position with one leg extended behind`,

  // ===== Cultural Section =====
  afrojazzCulturalHistoryTitle: 'History and Technique of Afro Jazz',
  afrojazzCulturalShort:
    "Afro Jazz is a unique concept created by Yunaisy Farray that fuses ancestral African power with Jazz technical sophistication. It's not simply a mix of styles: it's a proprietary methodology developed over 15 years that you'll only find at Farray's Dance Center Barcelona.",
  afrojazzCulturalFull: `### The Creation of Afro Jazz

Afro Jazz did not exist as a concept before Yunaisy Farray developed it. It is a unique technical fusion that honors African roots while incorporating Jazz dance precision.

**Yunaisy Farray**, trained at the prestigious **National School of Art of Cuba (ENA)**, dedicated over 15 years to developing this unique fusion. The result is the **Farray Method®**, a methodology that integrates codified African technique, Jazz vocabulary with lines and spatial projection, and a unique rhythmic connection that translates African polyrhythms with Jazz musicality.

**"Afro Jazz (Farray Method®): ENA Cuba + Jazz dance fusion, 15+ years of methodological development, only CID-UNESCO worldwide training."**

### Technical Fusion

Unlike other styles, Afro Jazz works extreme dynamic contrasts: from earth to air, from contraction to expansion, from rhythm to silence. The **Farray Method®** structures each class with progressive technical warm-up (15 min), diagonal exercises for traveling and projection, mirror work for choreography and repertoire, and cool-down with specific stretches.

**"Afro Jazz class structure: technical warm-up + diagonal (projection) + mirror (choreography) + cool-down. Systematized methodology."**

### International Recognition

Farray's Dance Center is the only academy in the world teaching Afro Jazz with its creator's original methodology, endorsed by **CID-UNESCO (International Dance Council)**. Internationally endorsed center since 2017, with over 15 years of methodological development and +15,000 students trained in Barcelona.

**"Farray's Center: only CID-UNESCO world center for Afro Jazz. Verifiable credential since 2017."**

### Why the Farray Method® is Different

What makes Yunaisy Farray's Afro Jazz unique: systematized and progressive methodology (vs. improvised), CID-UNESCO international endorsement (vs. no certification), direct training with the concept creator, and ENA Cuba + Jazz technique base (vs. diffuse origin).

**"Farray Method® vs other fusions: systematized, CID-UNESCO endorsed, direct creator, ENA+Jazz base."**

### Documented Physical Benefits

A 60-minute Afro Jazz class burns 400-600 calories per session, works 85% of muscle groups, measurably improves bilateral coordination, and develops flexibility and strength simultaneously.

**"Afro Jazz physical: 400-600 kcal/hour, 85% muscle groups, bilateral coordination + flexibility/strength."**

### Afro Jazz Today

Dancers from around the world travel to Barcelona specifically to train in Afro Jazz with Yunaisy Farray. It's a technical pilgrimage for those seeking the original source. Afro Jazz has become a reference discipline for dancers seeking technical versatility between African and contemporary styles, training with the concept creator, internationally recognized certification, and exclusive repertoire that exists nowhere else.

**"Afro Jazz Barcelona: world destination for original training. Versatility, CID-UNESCO certification, exclusive repertoire."**`,

Contemporary dance has its roots in American modern dance from the early 20th century.

**"American modern dance (1900–1950): Duncan, St. Denis, Shawn (Denishawn 1915) → breaking from classical ballet, natural earth-body movement."**

**Martha Graham (1894–1991)** developed **contraction-release** (emotional torso center), the fundamental basis of contemporary training.

**José Limón (1908–1972)** contributed **fall and recovery**, working with gravity for fluidity and musicality.

**Merce Cunningham (1919–2009)** separated dance from music/narrative, introducing compositional chance and torso-limb independence.

**"Contemporary base techniques: Graham (contraction-release), Limón (fall-recovery), Cunningham (chance composition/abstraction)."**

### Lyrical Contemporary: Technique and Emotion

**Lyrical contemporary** fuses modern technique with emotional/musical connection, maintaining narrative and expressiveness. Wide lines, fluidity and deep music-movement relationship distinguish it from pure abstraction.

**"Lyrical contemporary: modern technique + emotional narrative + musicality. Demanded style for technique-expression balance."**

### Floorwork

**Floorwork** distinguishes contemporary dance: **release technique** (letting go of tensions), **contact improvisation** (1970s) and fluid floor movement allow slides, rolls and organic transitions. The floor is an ally, not a limit.

**"Floorwork: release + contact improvisation. Floor as creative/technical ally in contemporary."**

### The Cuban School of Contemporary Dance

Cuba created from 1959 its **own school** (Ramiro Guerra), integrating American modern, classical and Afro-Cuban folklore. **ENA and ENBC** train with conservatory methodology: classical barre, modern, center, folklore, stage creation. Result: versatile, powerful, musical dancers.

**"ENA/ENBC Cuba: integral training (classical + modern + folk). Globally recognized conservatory methodology."**

### Contemporary at Farray's Center

**Specialist teachers trained in the Cuban school (ENA/ENBC)**, with solid technical base in ballet and contemporary. Integral training combining classical, modern and folk for professional results.

Modalities:
- **Basic Lyrical Contemporary**: fundamentals for beginners, musicality, expression.
- **Intermediate/Advanced Lyrical Contemporary**: complex phrasing, advanced stage work.
- **Floor & Flow**: release, transitions, contemporary dynamism.

**"Farray's: contemporary with Cuban school specialists (ENA/ENBC). Basic-advanced lyrical + floor/flow/release."**

### Physical and Cognitive Benefits

Works comprehensively: **flexibility, functional strength, coordination, proprioception, muscle memory**. Floorwork strengthens core/joint mobility. Improvisation drives creativity/concentration/mind-body.

**300-500 calories/hour** depending on intensity, plus emotional wellbeing and stress relief.

**"Farray's Contemporary (ENA/ENBC specialists): 300-500 cal/hour, flexibility/strength/coordination. CID-UNESCO plan, 5/5 Google (500+ reviews)."**`,

    'Learn Afro Contemporary (Contemporary Dance of Cuba) with the Farray Method®: exclusive pedagogy created by Yunaisy Farray (ENA Cuba) adapted for Europeans. Original DCC technique (Ramiro Guerra, 1959) with optimized progression for faster and stronger results.',
  afrocontemporaneoCulturalFull: `### The Farray Method®: DCC Adapted for Europeans

**The Farray Method® is an exclusive pedagogical system created by Yunaisy Farray to teach Afro Contemporary more solidly and effectively to European dancers.** Yunaisy, a Cuban trained at the National School of Art of Cuba (ENA), detected that the original Cuban methodology—designed for bodies that grow up dancing from childhood—needed to be adapted to the European context, where students arrive with different bodily and cultural backgrounds.

**"Farray Method® (Barcelona): DCC/ENA pedagogy adapted to European bodies; structured progression for faster and more solid results than traditional methodology."**

### The Origins: Contemporary Dance of Cuba (DCC, 1959)

**Afro Contemporary is the pedagogical name for Contemporary Dance of Cuba (DCC), founded by Ramiro Guerra in 1959.** This revolutionary discipline fuses **Martha Graham** techniques with Afro-Cuban roots (Yoruba rumba), and was officially systematized at the **ENA (National School of Art) in 1962**. The first generation of teachers includes figures such as **Méndez and Collazo (1959)**.

**"Afro Contemporary / DCC (1959, Ramiro Guerra): Graham + Afro-Cuban polyrhythm, ENA 1962."**

### Technical Fusion

What makes Afro Contemporary unique is its ability to integrate seemingly opposite elements:

- **Modern technique**: Contraction-release (Graham), fluidity (Limón), spatiality (Cunningham)
- **Cuban folklore**: Rumba undulations, energy of the Yoruba Orishas, Afro-Caribbean polyrhythm
- **Body expression**: Deep movement-music connection that goes beyond pure technique

**"DCC = Graham/Limón/Cunningham fusion + Yoruba rumba; hybrid technique requiring mastery of both worlds."**

### Music: Afro-Cuban Polyrhythm

**Afro Contemporary is practiced to music that fuses Afro-Cuban rhythms (batá, rumba, son) with contemporary compositions.** The characteristic polyrhythm requires the dancer to develop complex musicality and an interpretive capacity that goes beyond simple counting.

**"Afro-Cuban polyrhythm (batá, rumba, son) fused with contemporary music; rhythmic complexity develops advanced musicality."**

### Why the Farray Method® Works Better in Europe

**Yunaisy Farray adapted her ENA training for the European context**, creating a pedagogical progression that:

- **Builds the foundation from scratch**: Does not assume the student has years of prior training
- **Works body dissociation progressively**: Specific exercises for bodies that did not grow up with polyrhythm
- **Integrates technical explanation with practice**: More analytical methodology than traditional Cuban, adapted to European learning

**"Farray Method® (Yunaisy Farray, ENA Cuba → Barcelona): pedagogical progression specifically designed for European dancers; faster results than traditional ENA methodology."**

### International Recognition CID-UNESCO

The Afro Contemporary taught at **Farray's International Dance Center** is part of the professional dance training curriculum **endorsed by the CID-UNESCO** (International Dance Council, Paris). This recognition certifies both the authenticity of the DCC technique and the effectiveness of the Farray Method® for its teaching.

**"Farray's Center: only academy in Barcelona with Afro Contemporary (DCC) CID-UNESCO endorsed + exclusive Farray Method®."**

### Living Legacy: 65 Years of DCC

**Contemporary Dance of Cuba (DCC)** has been bringing Afro Contemporary to stages worldwide since the 1970s. With **65 years of international tours (2024)**, the company has consolidated Afro-modern Cuban fusion as one of Cuba's most valuable contributions to world dance. The Farray Method® brings this tradition to Barcelona with optimized pedagogy.

**"DCC: 65 years exporting Afro-modern Cuban fusion. Farray Method® brings this tradition to Europe with adapted pedagogy."**

### Physical and Cognitive Benefits

**Scientific studies on technical dance indicate that disciplines like Afro Contemporary improve complex motor coordination, proprioception, muscle memory, and body dissociation capacity, in addition to cardiovascular and flexibility benefits.**

**An Afro Contemporary class can burn 300-480 calories per hour depending on body weight and intensity, with simultaneous work on strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular endurance.**

**Farray's International Dance Center: Afro Contemporary (DCC) with exclusive Farray Method®, CID-UNESCO endorsement, 5/5 Google rating with over 500 reviews.**`,

  hiphopCulturalShort:
    'Hip Hop was born in the Bronx of New York in the early 70s, as a cultural expression of African American and Latino communities.',
  hiphopCulturalFull: `### The Origins: The South Bronx of New York (1973-1974)

**Hip Hop emerged in the South Bronx of New York between 1973 and 1974, when DJ Kool Herc began isolating the "breaks" (instrumental sections) from funk and soul records**, creating a new sound that invited dancing. The African American and Latino communities of the Bronx transformed the streets into stages for artistic expression.

**"Hip Hop dance was born between 1973-1974 in the South Bronx of New York, driven by DJ Kool Herc and developed by African American and Latino communities as a form of artistic expression."**

### The Four Foundational Pillars

Hip Hop culture is built on **four fundamental pillars**:
- **DJing** (turntablism): record manipulation and break creation
- **MCing** (rap): lyrical expression and rhymes
- **Graffiti**: urban visual art
- **B-boying/B-girling** (breaking): dance

**"The elements of hip hop dance — freestyle, battles and ciphers — define the competitive and community essence of this culture."**

### Pioneer Groups

Groups that established the technical and stylistic foundations still valid today:
- **The Rock Steady Crew** (1977): breaking pioneers
- **The Lockers** (1973): locking creators with Don Campbell
- **Electric Boogaloos** (1977): popping innovators with Boogaloo Sam

### Main Hip Hop Techniques

**The main techniques include: grooves and bounces (rhythmic base), social dances, toprock, footwork, freezes, power moves, and elements of locking, popping and breaking.** Each style has its own vocabulary and specific history.

### Breaking: Olympic Discipline

**Breaking was included as an Olympic sport at the Paris 2024 Games**, officially recognizing Hip Hop as an elite sports discipline. This historic milestone validates decades of technical and artistic development.

### From the Street to the World: Global Expansion

With more than **50 years of global development**, Hip Hop has gone from block parties in the Bronx to becoming a planetary cultural phenomenon. **Hip Hop is practiced by more than 30 million people worldwide.**

**"Hip hop dance is practiced both on the street and in professional academies, always maintaining its spirit of freedom and self-expression."**

### Health Benefits

**A 60-minute Hip Hop class can burn between 400-600 calories** while improving coordination, rhythm and body expression. **Studies show that dancing hip hop improves memory, concentration and reduces stress levels.**

### Hip Hop at Farray's Center

At our academy, Hip Hop is part of the professional dance training curriculum endorsed by **CID-UNESCO (International Dance Council of UNESCO in Paris)**. The methodology respects the roots of the culture: base technique, musicality, movement history and development of personal style through freestyle.

**"Hip Hop is not just a dance style, it's a life philosophy that promotes creativity, respect and self-improvement."**

Our teacher **Marcos Martínez**, judge of international competitions and reference of Hip Hop in Spain, transmits not only technique but the values and history that make this style unique.`,

  salsaCubanaProblemP1:
    'You go to a Cuban salsa academy. They teach you figures: enchufla, dile que no, setenta, vacílala. You memorize them. You repeat them. You learn 20, 30, 50 figures.',
  salsaCubanaProblemP2: 'But when you arrive at a real party, something fails.',
  salsaCubanaProblemP3:
    "You don't know when to use each figure. Your partner doesn't understand you. You feel stiff. You count \"1, 2, 3... 5, 6, 7\" in your head instead of feeling the music. And if you dance with someone who doesn't know the same figures as you, you freeze.",
  salsaCubanaProblemConclusion: 'The problem: They taught you to repeat sequences, not to dance.',
  salsaCubanaProblemExplanation:
    'Most academies teach "social casino": loose figures you memorize and execute mechanically. It works in class, with your usual partner, with the song you already know. But it doesn\'t make you a dancer.',

  salsaCubanaCulturalShort:
    'Cuban salsa, also known as "Casino", was born in Cuba in the 1950s as a fusion of Cuban Son, Mambo and other Afro-Cuban rhythms. Unlike line salsa, Casino is danced in a wheel with circular movements and partner changes.',
  salsaCubanaCulturalFull: `### Origins: Casino and the Social Clubs of Havana (1950s)

**Cuban salsa, originally known as "Casino", emerged in the social clubs of Havana during the 1950s.** The name comes from the Casino Deportivo de La Habana, where young people of that era developed this unique style dancing in "rueda" (wheel) and exchanging partners to the rhythm of Cuban son.

**"Casino was born in the Casino Deportivo de La Habana in the 1950s, fusing Cuban Son, Mambo, Cha-cha-chá and Afro-Cuban rhythms into a style of circular movements and inward turns."**

### Distinctive Characteristics of Casino

Unlike line salsa (LA or NY styles), Casino is characterized by:
- **Circular movements** instead of linear displacement
- **Inward turns** (opposite to line salsa)
- **Close connection** with the partner
- **More relaxed and playful style**
- **Improvisation** based on communication between dancers

**"Casino differs from line salsa by its circular movements, inward turns, close connection and more relaxed, playful character."**

### Rueda de Casino: Cultural Heritage

**Rueda de Casino is a group form of dancing Cuban salsa declared Cultural Heritage of Cuba.** Multiple couples form a circle and execute synchronized figures under the direction of a "caller" or leader, who calls out the names of figures for everyone to execute in unison.

This collective form of dancing reinforces the sense of community and shared musicality, fundamental elements of Cuban culture.

### The Music: Instrumentation and Rhythms

Cuban salsa music incorporates rich instrumentation:
- **Percussion**: congas, timbales, bongos, güiro, maracas, clave
- **Rhythm section**: piano, bass
- **Brass**: trumpets, trombones

The most danced rhythms include **timba, Cuban son, salsa dura and traditional casino**. The Cuban clave (3-2 or 2-3 rhythmic pattern) is the heart of the salsa rhythm.

### Musicality and Technique

**Musicality in Cuban salsa means dancing on the correct beat (usually on 1 or 3), interpreting breaks, changes and accents in the music, and emotionally expressing the content of each song.**

Leading and following are fundamental skills that allow clear, safe and elegant communication between dancers.

### Global Expansion

**From Cuba, salsa expanded globally from the 1970s, developing different regional styles.** New York developed salsa "on 2" (Mambo), Los Angeles salsa "on 1", while Casino remained the traditional Cuban style, preserving its circular movements and connection to Afro-Cuban roots.

### Health Benefits

**Fitness studies indicate that dancing salsa burns between 300-400 calories per hour, improves motor coordination, strengthens memory and reduces stress and anxiety levels.** Partner dancing also develops social skills and non-verbal communication.

### The Farray Method®

The Farray Method® rescues and teaches this authentic tradition with a unique pedagogical approach: **it prioritizes leading, following, musicality and partner connection before teaching complex figures.** This method has trained more than 15,000 students in countries like Finland, Italy, Germany and Spain.

**"The Farray Method® teaches specific techniques for clear, safe and elegant communication between dancers, respecting the essence of Cuban Casino."**`,

  salsaLadyCulturalShort:
    'Lady Style was born as a natural evolution of salsa dancing, when female dancers began to develop specific techniques to express their femininity within partner dancing.',
  salsaLadyCulturalFull: `### History and Origins of Lady Style

**Lady Style was born as an evolution of the female role in salsa, arising from dancers' need to express their personality and femininity within partner dancing.** Although its origins are difficult to trace precisely, it developed mainly in Latin dance schools in the United States and the Caribbean during the 1980s and 1990s.

**"Lady Style (also known as 'estilo chica' or 'ladies styling') emerged as an independent discipline when salsa female dancers began developing specific techniques to shine during freestyle and improvisation moments."**

### The Female Role in Salsa

**Traditionally, in Cuban salsa and other Latin styles, women adopted a "follower" role, responding to the leader's signals.** However, as dance evolved, women began claiming more prominence, developing their own techniques that allowed them to express their personality without depending exclusively on the leader.

**"Lady Style represents the technical and artistic emancipation of the salsa dancer, allowing her to shine with her own light during improvisation and freestyle moments."**

### Cuban Lady Style

**In Cuba, "estilo chica" was always an integral part of street dancing.** Cuban female dancers developed a unique way of moving that combines classical ballet technique (inherited from the Soviet-Cuban school) with the flavor, sensuality and flair of Afro-Cuban rhythms. This unique fusion distinguishes Cuban Lady Style and is the foundation of the Farray Method®.

**"Cuban Lady Style fuses classical ballet technique with Afro-Cuban sensuality, creating a unique style of feminine expression that exists nowhere else in the world."**

### The Farray Method®: The Methodology that Changed Everything

**Yunaisy Farray, trained at the prestigious National School of Art of Cuba (ENA), developed the Farray Method® as a complete system for teaching feminine style in dance.** Her methodology prioritizes:

- **Posture and bearing**: The foundation of all elegance and stage presence
- **Technical arm styling**: Arm movements with precision, grace and musicality
- **Hip work**: Dissociation, fluidity and controlled undulations
- **Spinning technique**: Balance, control and multiple turns
- **Walking in heels**: Elegance, confidence and sensuality in motion
- **Facial and body expression**: Communicating emotion through dance

**"The Farray Method® is the only Lady Style teaching system developed by a dancer trained at Cuba's National School of Art, combining technical rigor with Afro-Caribbean expressiveness."**

### Technical Elements of Lady Style

**The main techniques of Salsa Lady Style include six fundamental pillars:**

- **Arm styling**: Elegant lines, ballet-influenced port de bras and fluid arm movements that frame the body
- **Body movement**: Torso undulations, body rolls, body waves and integral body expression
- **Feminine footwork**: Decorative steps, tap steps, flicks and refined footwork
- **Spinning technique**: Multiple turns (singles, doubles, triples) with control, spotting and perfect balance
- **Hip work**: Circular movements, figure eights, dissociation and isolations that express the music
- **Stage presence**: Projection, gaze, attitude and connection with the audience

**"Lady Style techniques include arm styling, body movement, feminine footwork, spins, hip work and stage presence, forming a complete system of feminine expression in dance."**

### Health Benefits

**A 60-minute Salsa Lady Style class can burn between 300 and 400 calories**, combining intense cardiovascular work with specific muscle toning. Benefits include:

- **Toning**: Legs, glutes, core and arms work in an integrated way
- **Posture**: Significant improvement in bearing and body alignment
- **Coordination**: Development of motor coordination and laterality
- **Flexibility**: Increased range of joint motion
- **Self-esteem**: Connection with femininity and confidence building

    "Dancehall Classes in Barcelona | Authentic Jamaican Dancehall | Farray's Center",
  dancehallCulturalFull:
    "### The Origins: Kingston, Jamaica (1970s-1980s)\n\nDancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 1970s. It emerged as a natural evolution of reggae when sound systems (mobile sound systems) started bringing music to the streets and dancehalls (dance halls). The name \"dancehall\" comes from those spaces where the community gathered to dance, socialize, and express themselves. It was the place where social tensions were released through music and movement.\n\n### The Legends: Bogle, Passa Passa, and the Pioneers\n\n**Gerald \"Bogle\" Levy (1964-2005) is considered the father of modern Dancehall.** He created iconic moves like **Bogle, Row Di Boat, Log On, and Willie Bounce**, the foundation of Dancehall vocabulary.\n\n**Passa Passa**, the legendary street dancehall sessions in Tivoli Gardens (Kingston), was the epicenter where new steps were born and dancers were consecrated.\n\nOther pioneers like **Ding Dong, Keiva, John Hype** and crews like **Ravers Clavers** took Dancehall to an international level in the 2000s.\n\n### The Global Expansion (2000s-Present)\n\nIn the 2000s, Dancehall exploded globally thanks to artists like **Sean Paul, Shaggy, Elephant Man, and Beenie Man**. Social media and YouTube popularized moves like **Dutty Wine, Daggering, and Nuh Linga**.\n\nToday, Dancehall is a worldwide phenomenon with active communities in Europe, Africa, Asia, and America; Barcelona is one of its European epicenters.\n\n### The Music: Riddims and Sound System Culture\n\n**Dancehall is danced to riddims (instrumental tracks) that producers create and multiple artists vocalize.** Legendary riddims like **Diwali, Coolie Dance, or Dump Truck** defined entire eras.\n\nThe sound system culture—with its selectors, MCs, and the famous rewind when a song is so good it gets played again from the beginning—is essential to understanding Dancehall.\n\n### More Than Dance: Identity and Resistance\n\nDancehall has always been a form of cultural resistance and identity expression for Jamaica's marginalized communities. It's the voice of the ghettos, a celebration of joy despite difficulties.\n\nEach step has meaning: **Log On** (connect), **Willie Bounce** (tribute to Willie Haggart), **Nuh Linga** (don't linger). Every movement tells a story.\n\n### Dancehall at Farray's: technique and community\n\nAt Farray's International Dance Center, Dancehall is taught with technique, respect, and historical context, prioritizing good energy, movement precision, and a professional environment.",

  // Cultural History Section
  folkloreCulturalHistoryTitle: 'History and Origin of Cuban Folklore',
  folkloreCulturalShort:
    'Cuban Folklore is defined as the set of popular traditions transmitted orally, including ritual dances, music, legends ("Patakíes"), and cultural practices of the Cuban population, with strong emphasis on African-descendant roots adapted to the island context.',
  folkloreCulturalFull:
    '### Cultural influences\nSince the 16th century, Cuban folklore emerged from syncretism between African slaves (Yoruba, Congo, Arará), Spanish colonizers (romance, contradanza), and minor Caribbean contributions (Haitian, Jamaican), with almost non-existent aboriginal influence. Plantation socioeconomic conditions transformed African cults into expressions like Santería and Palo, where ritual dances preserve polyrhythm and ancestral gestures.\n### What is Afro Cuban?\n**Afro Cuban** (also called "Afro" or "Afro-Cuban dances") is the term that encompasses all Cuban dance expressions with African roots. When you search for **Afro classes in Barcelona** or **African dances**, Afro Cuban is the discipline that connects Africa with the Caribbean. Unlike pure African dances (Senegalese Sabar, Coupé Décalé), Afro Cuban fuses Yoruba, Congo, and Bantu movements with Caribbean musicality, creating a unique style that is the foundation of Cuban salsa.\n### Historical evolution\nIn the 19th century, secret societies and African cabildos maintained dances like Yoruba and Abakuá in religious contexts. In the early 20th century, the Cuban Folklore Society (1923-1930) initiated systematic study, while groups like Los Muñequitos de Matanzas professionalized rumba. Post-1959, institutions like the National School of Art codified these forms for stage.\n### Main manifestations\nTraditional folklore includes:\n**Yoruba:** Dances to Orishas (Eleguá, Yemayá, Obatalá, Ochún, Changó).\n**Congo/Bantu:** Palo, Makuta, Garabato.\n**Abakuá:** Efo, Efi.\n**Arará:** Afra, Gun, Jebbioso.\n**Iyesá:** Iyesá Dances.\n**Haitian:** Voodoo, Sabone, Fey, Congo Laye, Gagá, Tumba Francesa, Haitian Merengue, Ibbo, Menua.\n**Jamaican:** Banana, Brown, Mangú, Chulo, Cinta, Limbo.\n**Rumba:** Guaguancó, Yambú, and Columbia.

  folkloreFaqQ1: 'What exactly is Cuban Folklore?',
  folkloreFaqA1:
    'Cuban Folklore is the set of traditional Cuban dances with African roots. It includes ritual dances to the Orishas (Santería), dances of Yoruba, Congo, Arará origin, as well as Rumba in its different variants (Guaguancó, Yambú, Columbia). It is the foundation from which all Cuban salsa emerges.',
  folkloreFaqQ2: 'Do I need prior experience to learn Cuban Folklore?',
  folkloreFaqA2:
    'You do not need any prior experience. Our classes are designed to welcome all levels, from absolute beginners to advanced dancers who want to deepen their roots.',
  folkloreFaqQ3: 'Is Cuban Folklore related to religion?',
  folkloreFaqA3:
    'Cuban folklore has its origin in Afro-Cuban religious traditions (Santería, Palo, etc.), but in our classes, we teach it as an artistic and cultural discipline. You learn the movements and their historical-cultural meaning, without any mandatory religious component.',
  folkloreFaqQ4: 'Who are the Orishas and what dances will I learn?',
  folkloreFaqA4:
    'The Orishas are the deities of the Yoruba religion syncretized in Cuba. Each one has their own characteristic dance: Eleguá (the messenger), Ochún (sensuality), Yemayá (the sea), Changó (fire), Obatalá (peace), among others. You will learn the specific movements of each one.',
  folkloreFaqQ5: 'How will Folklore help me dance salsa better?',
  folkloreFaqA5:

  folkloreFaqQ6: 'What clothes do I need for classes?',
  folkloreFaqA6:
    'Comfortable, light clothing that allows freedom of movement, especially in hips and torso. You can use clean studio shoes or dance barefoot if you prefer. Bring a towel and water because it is intense training.',

  // SEO FAQs for Afro Cuban, Afro Barcelona, African Dances
  folkloreFaqQ11: 'What is Afro Cuban and how does it differ from Cuban Folklore?',
  folkloreFaqA11:
    'Afro Cuban is the term that encompasses all Cuban dances with African roots. Cuban Folklore includes Afro Cuban plus other expressions like Rumba and Comparsa dances. In our Folklore classes you will learn both aspects: the Afro dances to the Orishas (Eleguá, Changó, Yemayá, Ochún) and the more festive manifestations like Rumba.',
  folkloreFaqQ12: 'Can I learn African dances in Barcelona with you?',
  folkloreFaqA12:
    'Yes. Afro Cuban is the most authentic way to connect with African dances in Barcelona. Our movements come directly from Yoruba, Congo, and Bantu traditions that arrived in Cuba with African slaves. If you are looking for African dance classes, Afro Cuban offers that connection with authentic roots plus the rhythmic richness of the Caribbean.',
  folkloreFaqQ13: 'What is the difference between Afro Cuban and Afrobeat or Afro Contemporary?',
  folkloreFaqA13:
    "Afro Cuban is based on Yoruba and Congo ritual dances adapted in Cuba (16th-19th centuries). Afrobeat is a Nigerian musical genre from the 70s with its own dance. Afro Contemporary fuses African techniques with modern contemporary dance. At Farray's we offer all three disciplines, but Afro Cuban is the one that connects with the oldest roots and salsa.",
  folkloreFaqQ14: 'Will Afro Cuban classes help me improve in other styles?',
  folkloreFaqA14:
    'Absolutely. Afro Cuban is the foundation of Cuban salsa, son, timba, and many Latin rhythms. By learning the gestures of the Orishas, the polyrhythm of batá drums, and African body dissociation, your dancing in any Latin style will improve significantly. Many salsa dancers come to our Afro classes to deepen their practice.',

  timbaCulturalShort:
    'Timba was born in Cuba in the 80s-90s as an evolution of Son and Salsa, fusing traditional African rhythms with modern genres.',
  timbaCulturalFull: `### The Origins of Timba (Cuba, 1980s-1990s)

**Timba emerged in Havana during the 80s and reached its peak expression in the 90s.** It is the result of the natural evolution of Cuban music, when young Cuban musicians began fusing traditional Son with influences from funk, hip hop, rock and jazz. This revolutionary fusion created an explosive genre that transformed the way Cuban salsa is danced.

**"Cuban Timba (1980s-1990s): fusion of traditional Son + funk + hip hop + rock + jazz; musical revolution that transformed Cuban dance."**

### Why is it called "Timba"?

**The term "Timba" has roots in popular Cuban slang.** Some relate it to "timbales" (percussion instrument), others to popular Cuban expressions denoting flavor and authenticity. What everyone agrees on is that it represents something intense, street-wise and authentic from Cuban culture.

**"Timba = intensity + street + authenticity; Cuban slang term that defines the essence of the genre."**

### The Bands that Defined the Genre

**Groups like Los Van Van, NG La Banda, La Charanga Habanera, Manolín "El Médico de la Salsa" and Paulito FG were the pioneers who defined the Timba sound.** Their music is characterized by:

- **Constant rhythm changes** (from soft to explosive)
- **The "despelote"** - sections where the rhythm intensifies and dancers improvise
- **Urban lyrics** that talk about everyday Cuban life
- **Improvisation** both musical and in dance

**"Timba pioneers: Los Van Van, NG La Banda, La Charanga Habanera, Paulito FG; creators of the sound that defines the genre."**

### Timba as Dance: The Despelote

**Musically, Timba demands a different dance than traditional salsa.** Dancers developed looser, more sensual and expressive movements to respond to the constant changes in the music. This is how the Timba dance style was born, with its characteristic "despelote" (moment of maximum intensity) and freedom of individual movement.

**"Timba dance = body response to rhythm changes + despelote + free improvisation; requires mastery of musical interpretation."**

### Lady Timba: The Cuban Feminine Style

**Lady Timba or "Timba for women" focuses on developing the feminine style within this genre.** It emphasizes hip movements, sensuality and body expression, allowing women to shine when they dance alone or when they are "let go" in partner dancing. It's a discipline that empowers and develops femininity in dance.

**"Lady Timba: Cuban feminine style; hip movements + sensuality + body expression to shine in the despelote."**

### Timba in Barcelona: Farray's Center

**Timba continues to evolve in Cuba and around the world. In Barcelona, Farray's Center is a reference in teaching authentic Timba** with Cuban teachers who transmit not just the steps, but the feeling and culture behind each movement. Yunaisy Farray (CID-UNESCO) leads the Lady Timba program with professional methodology.

**"Farray's Center Barcelona: reference in authentic Cuban Timba; CID-UNESCO Cuban teachers; Lady Timba + Partner Timba."**

### Benefits of Dancing Timba

**Dancing Timba uniquely develops musicality, coordination and body expression.** The rhythmic complexity of Timba music trains the musical ear and reaction capacity. Additionally, the social character of the dance strengthens confidence and connection with other dancers.

**"Timba develops: advanced musicality + coordination + body expression + social confidence; comprehensive dancer training."**`,

  // === CULTURAL HISTORY SECTION ===
  stretchingCulturalHistoryTitle: 'The Science of Stretching',
  stretchingCulturalShort:
    'Stretching has evolved from simple stretches to a scientific discipline that combines anatomy, physiology and techniques from different traditions.',
  stretchingCulturalFull: `### Origins of Modern Stretching

**Stretching as a scientific discipline has its roots in millennial practices such as yoga (5000+ years) and oriental martial arts.** However, it was in the 1970s that it was systematized as specific training with a scientific basis.

**"Stretching (Bob Anderson, 1975): first scientific stretching manual, +3.5 million copies sold, basis of modern stretching."**

### Bob Anderson and the Stretching Revolution (1975)

**Bob Anderson is considered the father of modern stretching.** His book "Stretching" (1975) sold more than 3.5 million copies and was translated into 23 languages, establishing the foundations of what we now know as static stretching. Anderson was the first to systematize stretches with an accessible and scientific approach for the general public.

**"Bob Anderson (1975): popularized static stretching as an essential complement to physical exercise."**

### PNF: Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation

**The Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) technique revolutionized the field of flexibility.** Originally developed for rehabilitation of polio patients in the 1940s-50s by Herman Kabat, it was adapted to sports training in the 80s. Studies show that PNF can increase flexibility up to 30% faster than traditional static stretching.

**"PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation): combines muscle contraction-relaxation; +30% effectiveness vs. traditional static stretching."**

### Backbending: The Art of Posterior Flexibility

**Backbending (posterior spinal flexion) has been refined over generations by gymnasts, ballet dancers and professional contortionists.** Russian and Chinese circus schools have developed specific methodologies that allow working on back flexibility safely and progressively.

**"Backbending: posterior spinal flexion; technique developed by Olympic gymnasts, ballet dancers and professional contortionists."**

### The Farray Method: Fusion of Traditions

**At Farray's Center we have developed our own methodology that combines the best of each tradition:** the patience and body awareness of yoga, the technical rigor of classical ballet, PNF techniques from sports rehabilitation, and knowledge of modern anatomy.

The Farray Method is characterized by:
- **Structured progression**: 4 levels (Beginners → Basic → Intermediate → Intermediate/Advanced)
- **Specialization in backbending and legs**: specific 1h30 classes for deep work
- **Individualized approach**: adaptation to each body and flexibility level
- **Scientific basis**: PNF techniques combined with static stretches

**"Farray Method (Barcelona): fusion yoga + ballet + PNF + modern anatomy; 4 levels of structured progression."**

### Scientifically Proven Benefits

Scientific studies confirm that regular stretching 3+ times per week:

- **Improves 15-20%** joint range of motion in 4-8 weeks
- **Reduces 30%** risk of muscle injuries
- **Relieves** chronic back and neck pain
- **Improves** blood and lymphatic circulation
- **Reduces** stress and cortisol levels
- **Burns 150-200** calories per 60-minute session

**"Regular stretching: +15-20% flexibility in 4-8 weeks, -30% injury risk, 150-200 cal/hour."**`,

  stretchingFaqQ5: 'Does stretching help relieve back pain?',
  stretchingFaqA5:
    'Yes. Studies show that regular stretching reduces back pain in 30-50% of cases. Stretching strengthens the core, improves posture and releases accumulated muscle tension.

  stretchingFaqA10:
    "Yes, it's the ideal combination. Stretching complements any dance style by improving your range of motion and preventing injuries. Recommendation: 1-2 stretching classes per week + your regular dance classes. Many students combine Bachata/Salsa + Stretching or Urban Dances + Backbending & Legs.",
  stretchingFaqQ11: 'How long until I see results in my flexibility?',
  stretchingFaqA11:
    '<strong>First 2-4 weeks</strong>: less morning stiffness, less muscle pain, better posture. <strong>1-2 months</strong>: visible increase in range of motion (15-20% more flexibility). <strong>3-6 months</strong>: significant changes (being able to touch your feet, half split). <strong>6-12 months</strong>: advanced goals (full split, bridge). Results with practice 2-3 times per week.',
  stretchingFaqQ12: 'Will stretching help me do the splits?',
  stretchingFaqA12:
    'Yes. In Backbending & Legs classes we specifically work towards the front split (legs front-back) and side split (legs to the sides).

  bumbumCulturalHistoryTitle: 'The Science of Glute Training',
  bumbumCulturalShort:
    'Specific glute training has evolved from basic exercises to scientifically designed programs that maximize muscle activation.',
  bumbumCulturalFull: `### The Hip Thrust: The Revolution in Glute Training

**The hip thrust is considered the most effective exercise for gluteus maximus development according to electromyography (EMG) studies.** Popularized by researcher Bret Contreras (known as "The Glute Guy"), this exercise has revolutionized glute training in the last decade.

**"Hip thrust: #1 exercise for glutes according to EMG; maximum gluteus maximus activation at full hip extension."**

### Glute Anatomy: 3 Key Muscles

**The glutes are the largest and most powerful muscle group in the human body**, composed of three main muscles:

- **Gluteus maximus**: The largest, responsible for hip extension and the rounded shape of the glute
- **Gluteus medius**: Lateral hip stabilizer, important for walking and balance
- **Gluteus minimus**: The deepest, works with the medius for stabilization

**"Glutes: largest muscle group in the body; 3 muscles (maximus, medius, minimus) essential for posture, power and stability."**

### The 5 Most Effective Glute Exercises

According to scientific muscle activation studies:

1. **Hip Thrust** - Maximum gluteus maximus activation
2. **Deep Squat** - Complete lower body work
3. **Glute Bridge** - Weightless version of the hip thrust
4. **Romanian Deadlift** - Emphasis on hamstrings and glutes
5. **Lunges** - Unilateral work and balance

**"Top 5 glute exercises (EMG): hip thrust > squat > glute bridge > Romanian deadlift > lunges."**

### The Farray Method Applied to Glutes

**At Farray's Center we have adapted our methodology to glute training**, combining:

- **Scientifically proven exercises**: Hip thrust, squats, glute bridge
- **Dance techniques**: Rhythm, music and movement to make training fun
- **Safe progressions**: Adaptation to each level individually
- **Conscious activation**: Mind-muscle connection to maximize results

**"Farray Glutes Method (Barcelona): hip thrust + dance techniques + personalized progression; results from 4-6 weeks."**

### Scientifically Proven Benefits

Regular glute training (2-3 times/week):

- **Reduces 50%** lower back pain risk according to physiotherapy studies
- **Improves** posture and pelvic stability
- **Increases** power in activities like running, jumping and dancing
- **Prevents** knee and hip injuries
- **Burns 300-400** calories per 60-minute session

**"Glute training: -50% lower back pain, +power, +stability, 300-400 cal/hour."**`,

    "Hip thrust is a hip extension exercise that activates the gluteus maximus more than any other exercise according to electromyography (EMG) studies. It's the #1 recommended exercise by experts like Bret Contreras for developing strong glutes with volume.",
  bumbumFaqQ4: 'How long until I see results in my glutes?',
  bumbumFaqA4:
    '<strong>First 2-4 weeks</strong>: you\'ll notice your glutes feel more "active" and firm to the touch. <strong>4-8 weeks</strong>: visible changes in tone and shape. <strong>3-6 months</strong>: noticeable increase in volume and definition. Results with 1 weekly class + complementary exercise.',
  bumbumFaqQ5: 'Does glute training help with lower back pain?',

    'Yes. Physiotherapy studies show that strengthening the glutes reduces lower back pain by up to 50%. Strong glutes stabilize the pelvis and reduce load on the lower back. Many of our students notice significant relief.',
  bumbumFaqQ6: 'What should I bring to Bum Bum Glutes class?',
  bumbumFaqA6:
    '<strong>Required equipment</strong>: comfortable workout clothes (leggings, t-shirt), athletic shoes, small towel, water bottle. <strong>Optional</strong>: resistance bands (we provide them).',
  bumbumFaqQ7: 'Is it only for women?',
  bumbumFaqA7:
    'No. Although most participants are women, men can also benefit greatly from glute training. Strong glutes improve athletic performance, prevent injuries and improve posture in anyone.',
  bumbumFaqQ8: 'How much does the Bum Bum Glutes trial class cost?',

  bumbumFaqQ11: 'How many calories are burned in a class?',
  bumbumFaqA11:
    "A 60-minute Bum Bum Amazing Glutes class burns approximately 300-400 calories, depending on your body weight and intensity. It's strength training with an aerobic component thanks to the dance techniques.",
  bumbumFaqQ12: 'Does glute training increase volume or just tone?',
  bumbumFaqA12:
    'Both. Exercises like hip thrust and squats develop muscle (hypertrophy), which increases volume. At the same time, regular training reduces body fat and improves muscle definition. The result is glutes that are both larger AND more toned.',
  bumbumFaqQ13: 'Can I do Bum Bum Glutes if I have knee problems?',
  bumbumFaqA13:
    "It depends on the specific condition. Hip thrust is generally safe for knees because it doesn't involve deep flexion. However, we recommend consulting with your doctor first and letting Cris know at the start of class to adapt exercises.",

  bachataLadyCulturalFull: `### The Evolution of Bachata Lady Style

Bachata lady style builds on the evolution of bachata from its traditional roots in the Dominican Republic to today's urban and sensual bachata, where the dancer's prominence grows with the use of adornments, body isolations and body expression.

**"Bachata Lady Style: a line of technical and expressive work that develops the feminine style within modern bachata, focused on arm styling, body waves, hips and stage presence."**

### History and Origin of Bachata

Bachata was born in the Dominican Republic in the mid-20th century as popular guitar music, influenced by bolero, son and other Caribbean genres. For decades it was associated with humble environments and suburban bars, until in the 80s-90s it became professionalized and began its international expansion thanks to artists like Juan Luis Guerra and the Latin industry.

**"Bachata was born in the Dominican Republic (mid-20th century): popular guitar music influenced by bolero, son and Caribbean genres. International expansion in the 80s-90s with Juan Luis Guerra."**

### From Traditional Bachata to Urban Bachata

With the global spread of bachata since the 2000s, new scenic and urban styles emerged (modern, urban and sensual bachata), incorporating influences from ballroom, jazz, contemporary and urban dances. In this context, specific "ladies styling / lady style" classes appeared, where women work on spins, body waves, lines and attitude on the bachata base, both in partners and solo.

**"Bachata Lady Style emerged in the 2010s with the globalization of sensual bachata, when female dancers sought spaces to develop feminine technique independently."**

### What is Bachata Lady Style?

Bachata lady style is the line of technical and expressive work that develops the feminine style within modern bachata. It focuses on arm usage (arm styling), torso and hip isolation, weight control, walking with presence and feminine gestures, so the dancer can shine in solo moments or shines within partner dancing.

**"Bachata Lady Style: arm styling (elegant arm work), body movement (waves and rolls), hip work (figure eights, accents), spins with spotting, and stage presence."**

### Technical Elements of Bachata Lady Style

In bachata lady style classes we work on elements such as:

**Arm styling:** elegant lines, fluidity and coordination with the torso.

**Body movement:** waves, rolls, inclinations and level changes.

**Hips:** lateral movements, figure eights and soft or accented marks.

**Spins:** clean technique, spotting and balance.

**Stage presence:** gaze, attitude, musicality and connection with lyrics.

**"An active Bachata Lady Style class can burn 250-400 calories per hour depending on intensity and heel use."**

### Lady Style and Female Empowerment

Like salsa lady style, bachata lady style has become a tool for female empowerment in dance schools worldwide. It offers women a space to work on self-esteem, sensuality and confidence in their movement, beyond the traditional follower role.

**"Bachata Lady Style has become a tool for female empowerment, offering space to work on self-esteem, sensuality and body confidence."**

### Bachata Lady Style in Barcelona

In cities like Barcelona, bachata lady style is part of the regular offering of academies specializing in Latin rhythms, where modern bachata technique is combined with jazz, contemporary or urban bases to refine style. In this context, schools like Farray's International Dance Center integrate lady style work within their global approach to Latin and urban dance, emphasizing musicality, technique and each dancer's own personality.

    "Dancing salsa isn't just fun: it's a powerful tool for improving your physical, mental, and social health, with benefits backed by research from institutions like Harvard and the *New England Journal of Medicine*.\n\nI've spent years watching people who start dancing experience real changes in their bodies and moods. In this guide, I share the **11 main benefits** of dancing salsa, with links to the original studies so you can dig deeper. If you're in Barcelona, I'll also tell you how to get started with [our Cuban salsa classes](/en/clases/salsa-cubana-barcelona).",

  // Benefit 1: Calories
  blogBeneficiosSalsa_benefit1Title: '1. Burns Between 300 and 450 Calories per Hour',
  blogBeneficiosSalsa_benefit1Content:
    "A moderate-to-high intensity Cuban salsa session can burn approximately **300-450 kcal per hour** for someone weighing around 70 kg. This figure is comparable to moderate-pace running, according to estimates based on [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-for-people-of-three-different-weights) caloric expenditure tables.\n\nThe big difference with other exercises is that in a [salsa class](/en/clases/salsa-cubana-barcelona) time flies because you're having fun. And that's key: consistency is what really transforms your body, and it's much easier to stay consistent when you're enjoying yourself.",
  blogBeneficiosSalsa_stat1Label: 'approximate kcal per hour',

  // Benefit 2: Cardiovascular
  blogBeneficiosSalsa_benefit2Title: '2. Improves Your Cardiovascular Health',
  blogBeneficiosSalsa_benefit2Content:
    'Salsa is moderate-intensity aerobic exercise that combines continuous movement, direction changes, leg work, and core engagement. Studies on [dance and cardiovascular health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S053155651830439X) show improvements in cardiorespiratory capacity, blood pressure, and body composition in adults who dance regularly.\n\nThat\'s why many health professionals consider dancing an effective form of cardiovascular training "disguised" as fun. If you\'re looking to care for your heart without getting bored, try our [salsa bachata classes](/en/clases/salsa-bachata-barcelona).',

  // Benefit 3: Muscles
  blogBeneficiosSalsa_benefit3Title: '3. Strengthens Muscles, Balance, and Coordination',
  blogBeneficiosSalsa_benefit3Content:
    'Every salsa step works multiple muscle groups: **legs, glutes, core**, and in many patterns, arms and back too. Systematic reviews on [dance and motor function](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30543905/) highlight improvements in balance, coordination, functional strength, and flexibility.\n\nUnlike repeating the same exercises on a machine, salsa offers complete functional training with patterns that demand reaction and constant weight shifts. Complement your practice with our [stretching](/en/clases/stretching-barcelona) or [physical conditioning](/en/clases/acondicionamiento-fisico-bailarines) classes.',

  bachataV3FaqSubtitle: 'We answer your doubts so you can dance with confidence.',
  bachataV3FaqQ1: 'What is sensual bachata and how is it different from other bachata styles?',
  bachataV3FaqA1:
    "Sensual bachata is a modern evolution of Dominican bachata that emphasizes body connection, musical interpretation and fluid movements like waves and dips. Unlike Dominican bachata (faster, with more footwork) or bachata fusion (mixed with other styles), sensual bachata focuses on couple connection and body expression. At Farray's we mainly teach sensual bachata, although we touch on elements of social bachata and bachata fusion in advanced classes.",
  bachataV3FaqQ2: "Do I need a partner to learn bachata at Farray's?",
  bachataV3FaqA2:
    "No, you don't need to come with a partner. In our classes we rotate partners constantly, which is actually better for learning because you learn to dance with different people. Many of our students come alone and that's how they meet friends and even partners.",
  bachataV3FaqQ3: 'What is the difference between sensual bachata and Dominican bachata?',
  bachataV3FaqA3:
    "Dominican bachata is the original style, faster, with more footwork and closer to Dominican roots. Sensual bachata is a European evolution that focuses more on body connection, waves and dips. At Farray's we teach sensual bachata as the main style because it's the most danced at European socials, but we include Dominican technique elements to give you a solid foundation.",
  bachataV3FaqQ4: 'How long does it take to learn sensual bachata?',
  bachataV3FaqA4:
    'In 3 months of regular classes you will be able to dance comfortably at any social. In 6 months you will feel like a completely different dancer. Of course, bachata is an art that you keep perfecting your whole life, but to enjoy socials, 3-6 months is enough.',
  bachataV3FaqQ5: 'What bachata level do I need to dance at social parties?',
  bachataV3FaqA5:
    'With our basic level (about 3 months) you can already enjoy social bachata parties. You will know enough moves to have fun and connect with your partner. At socials you dance with all levels, so you will always find people to dance with.',
  bachataV3FaqQ6: 'Can I learn bachata without previous dance experience?',
  bachataV3FaqA6:
    "Absolutely! Many of our students have never danced before. Our beginner class is designed specifically for people starting from zero. You don't need rhythm, experience or special abilities. We teach you everything.",
  bachataV3FaqQ7: "What is bachata fusion and do you teach it at Farray's?",
  bachataV3FaqA7:
    "Bachata fusion is a style that mixes bachata with elements of hip hop, contemporary, zouk and other dances. At Farray's our main focus is sensual bachata, but our advanced teachers include fusion elements in their choreographies. If you are specifically interested in fusion, ask about our masterclasses and special events.",
  bachataV3FaqQ8: "What is Farray's bachata teaching method?",
  bachataV3FaqA8:
    'Our method combines solid technique with fun and creative expression. We start with basics (rhythm, basic step, simple turns), progress to body connection and waves, and finally work on musicality and personal style. Our teachers are world champions who have adapted their knowledge for all levels.',
  bachataV3FaqQ9: "Are there bachata social events at Farray's?",
  bachataV3FaqA9:
    "Yes! We organize weekly practices and monthly socials where you can dance what you learn in class. We also organize trips to national and international bachata congresses. Our community is very active and you'll always have somewhere to dance.",

  // === INTRODUCTION ===
  blogSalsaRitmo_intro:
    'Few dances concentrate as much history and passion as **salsa**. More than a dance, it is the result of a long journey between cultures, of comings and goings between Africa, Europe, the Caribbean and the Americas. Its roots are in Cuba, in the meeting between [African rhythmic traditions](https://www.arecibo.inter.edu/wp-content/uploads/biblioteca/pdf/salsa.pdf) and European melodies.',
  blogSalsaRitmo_intro2:
    'But its expansion and evolution turned it into **the quintessential musical language of the Latino community**. To speak of modern salsa is to speak of a living, changing and powerful genre, where each step tells centuries of rhythm and mestizaje.',

  // === SECTION 1: ORIGINS ===
  blogSalsaRitmo_origenesTitle: 'Origins of Salsa: Mestizaje and Evolution',
  blogSalsaRitmo_origenesContent1:
    'Before salsa as we know it existed, Cuba was already dancing and playing a wide range of rhythms that today form its DNA: the **[danzón](https://www.muchomasquebaile.es/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Historia-de-la-salsa-desde-las-raices-hasta-el-1975.pdf)**, the **son**, the **guaracha**, the **rumba** and the **cha-cha-chá**. The danzón, very popular since the late 19th century, united elegance and closeness between couples; while **Cuban son**—from the late 1800s—mixed African percussion with Spanish guitars, giving rise to the rhythmic base of salsa.',
  blogSalsaRitmo_origenesContent2:
    'In the following years, genres like **mambo** (popularized by Dámaso Pérez Prado) and **cha-cha-chá** (created by Enrique Jorrín) continued to expand the horizon of Cuban dance. Through Caribbean migration, these styles traveled to **Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Dominican Republic and the United States**, especially to **[New York](https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/8889123.pdf)**, where they fused with **jazz**, **soul** and **R&B**. From that encounter, modern salsa was born: an urban, vibrant and communal music, a symbol of [identity for millions of people](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_%28g%C3%A9nero_musical%29).',

  // === SECTION 2: STYLES ===

  blogSalsaRitmo_ruedaContent2:
    "In a rueda, several couples dance forming a **synchronized circle** guided by a *leader* or *caller*, who indicates each figure or change. The couples rotate, cross and constantly exchange, creating a dynamic spectacle full of collective energy. At **[Farray's International Dance Center](/en/clases)**, rueda de casino is one of the most beloved activities.

  blogSalsaRitmo_proyeccionContent1:
    'Salsa is pure communication. Each couple tells a different story: the man proposes, leads; the woman responds, interprets and shines with expression and elegance. However, those traditional conventions are now reinterpreted from equality: on the dance floor, both lead, both create.',
  blogSalsaRitmo_proyeccionContent2:
    'In our classes, it is common to see **women dancing together** or people changing roles to learn both sides of the dance. The magic of the genre lies in the **[scenic projection](https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/8889123.pdf)**. The connection, the smile, the play of glances and improvisation make salsa one of the most captivating spectacles in the world.',

According to [Peter Manuel (1995)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Caribbean_Currents.html?id=TUUhDQAAQBAJ), bachata represents a unique fusion of romantic bolero, Cuban son and Dominican merengue that crystallized in the 60s.',

  blogHistoriaBachata_origenesContent1:
    "Bachata's DNA is forged in the [Dominican Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic) of the 1960s. It fuses Cuban **romantic bolero**, **son** and local **merengue**, creating a distinctive sound characterized by the requinto guitar, güiro and bongó. According to [Deborah Pacini Hernández (1995)](https://archive.org/details/bachatasocialhist00paci), bachata emerges as a musical expression of the urban popular classes.",

Through changing our behavior, we will change our thinking; but we will continue to need spaces where we can express our multiple identities and give outlet to realities as natural as the need for human contact, affection, acceptance; even more, the desire to seduce and be seduced, to touch and be touched. Virtual relationship spaces fall short when it comes to providing a multisensory experience.',
  blogClasesSalsaBarcelona_section1Title: 'The dance floor: a shared stage',
  blogClasesSalsaBarcelona_section1Content:
    'The dance floor, on the other hand, provides us with a stage where men and women can share something that is much more than a hobby; it is a way of understanding life, interpreting music and relating to our own body. And if salsa is danced on that floor, the possibilities for interaction multiply. Each song change implies a partner change, understanding "partner" as two people dancing together; many times we see women dancing with women, but there are also, and there will be more and more, happy men dancing with other men. And they don\'t clash, because the good vibes emanating from a couple that dances and feels the same rhythm go beyond gender. This environment of full awareness, of maximum enjoyment, fosters healthy emotional relationships, friendship and acceptance of the other, whether man or woman.',

  cuerpofitCulturalHistoryTitle: `The Science of Body Conditioning for Dancers`,
  cuerpofitCulturalShort: `Modern body conditioning for dancers integrates knowledge of biomechanics, exercise physiology and dance pedagogy to create specific training programs.`,
  cuerpofitCulturalFull: `### History of Physical Conditioning in Dance\n\n**Specific physical training for dancers has its roots in the classical ballet tradition.** Teachers like Agrippina Vaganova (1879-1951) already incorporated strengthening exercises into their methodologies, though in a less systematic way than today.\n\n**"Pilates (Joseph Pilates, 1920s): originally developed to rehabilitate injured New York City Ballet dancers."**\n\n### The Pilates Revolution\n\n**Joseph Pilates developed his "Contrology" method working with New York City Ballet dancers in the 1940-60s.** George Balanchine and Martha Graham were pioneers in incorporating Pilates into their companies' training, establishing the foundation of what we now know as "cross-training" for dancers.\n\n**"Gyrotonic (Julio Horvath, 1980s): three-dimensional training system created by a former dancer for dancers."**\n\n### Modern Functional Training\n\n**Eric Franklin (Franklin Method, 1994) revolutionized the field by integrating mental imagery with physical training.** His dynamic visualization techniques improve proprioception and neuromuscular control, essential elements for dancers.\n\n**"Eric Franklin (1994): introduced neuroplasticity applied to dance training."**\n\n### Science-Backed Benefits\n\nSports medicine studies applied to dance show that:\n- Strength training reduces injuries in dancers by 50-70%\n- Active flexibility is 40% more functional than passive flexibility for performance\n- Core training improves balance and turn control by 35%\n- Specific plyometrics increase jump height by 15-25%\n\n### The Farray Method® in Body Conditioning\n\nThe Farray Method® integrates elements of Pilates, functional yoga, strength training and joint mobility into a system specifically designed for the demands of contemporary and urban dance. The key is working functional movement patterns, not isolated muscles.`,
  cuerpofitCitableDefinicion: `Body conditioning for dancers: comprehensive physical training that develops functional strength, active flexibility, joint mobility and specific endurance for dance demands.`,
  cuerpofitCitableOrigen: `Joseph Pilates (1940s): pioneer of physical conditioning for dancers, worked with New York City Ballet and Martha Graham Company.`,
  cuerpofitCitableBeneficios: `Studies show: -50-70% injuries, +35% turn control, +15-25% jump height with specific dance training.`,

  cuerpofitCitableFact1: `60-min body conditioning class burns 350 kcal (moderate-high intensity with strength component).`,

  cuerpofitFaqTitle: `Frequently Asked Questions about Body Conditioning`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ1: `Do I need to be a dancer to do body conditioning?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA1: `It's not essential, although the class is designed with dance demands in mind. If you practice any type of dance (urban, Latin, contemporary, etc.), you'll benefit enormously. It's also ideal for athletes who want to improve flexibility and body control, or anyone seeking complete functional training.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ2: `What's the difference between body conditioning and Pilates?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA2: `Body conditioning is broader and incorporates Pilates elements, but also functional yoga, bodyweight strength training, joint mobility and dance-specific exercises. Pilates focuses mainly on core and posture; body conditioning works the whole body with a focus on movement performance.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ3: `What's the difference between body conditioning and stretching classes?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA3: `Stretching focuses on increasing passive and active flexibility. Body conditioning is more comprehensive: it works strength, endurance, mobility and flexibility. They're complementary: many students do both classes. Stretching to gain range of motion, body conditioning to strengthen it.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ4: `Is it an intense class? Will I be exhausted?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA4: `The intensity is moderate-high but controlled. It's not HIIT or CrossFit. It's conscious strength and control work. You'll be tired but not destroyed. The class is designed so you can take other dance classes afterward without problem.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ5: `What should I bring to class?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA5: `Comfortable workout clothes that allow wide movement (leggings, fitted t-shirt or top). Barefoot or with socks (no shoes). Small towel and water bottle. We provide the mats.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ6: `Does it help prevent dance injuries?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA6: `Yes, it's one of the main objectives. Studies show that dancers with regular strength training have 50-70% fewer injuries. Body conditioning strengthens the most vulnerable areas (hips, knees, ankles, back) and corrects muscular imbalances.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ7: `How much does the trial class cost?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA7: `The trial class costs 10€ and has no commitment. You can try any Monday at 7pm. If you like it, there are monthly passes from 40€. Check all prices at reception or on our website.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ8: `Is there a contract or commitment?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA8: `No. Monthly passes without commitment. You can come and go as you please. We value your freedom and want you to come because you want to, not because you're tied to a contract.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ9: `Can I combine body conditioning with other classes?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA9: `Yes, it's the ideal combination. We recommend: body conditioning (physical foundation) + your regular dance classes + optional stretching. Many students combine Monday body conditioning + Tuesday/Thursday dance. Our passes allow flexible combinations.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ10: `How long until I see results?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA10: `2-4 weeks: you'll notice better body control and less fatigue in dance class. 1-2 months: visible improvement in strength and endurance. 3-6 months: significant performance transformation. Consistency is key: minimum 1 weekly class.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ11: `Do I need to be in good shape to start?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA11: `No. The class is adaptable to all levels. Each exercise has variations from beginner to advanced. Cris guides you according to your current level. Many students started without doing any exercise and are now in their best shape ever.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ12: `Is it good for back pain?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA12: `Yes, strengthening core and glutes significantly reduces lower back pain. 70% of students with chronic lumbar pain report improvement in the first 4-6 weeks. If you have an active injury, consult with your doctor first.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ13: `Who teaches the classes?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA13: `Cris Ag, specialist in physical conditioning for dancers, trained in the Farray Method®. She also teaches stretching and glute workout classes. Her approach combines anatomical knowledge with practical dance experience.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ14: `What's the difference from going to the gym?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA14: `At the gym you work isolated muscles with machines. In body conditioning you work functional movement patterns with your own body. The exercises are designed to transfer directly to dance: extensions, turns, jumps, direction changes.`,
  cuerpofitFaqQ15: `Where is the academy and how can I contact you?`,
  cuerpofitFaqA15: `Farray's Center is at Calle Entença 100, Barcelona (between Plaza España and Sants). Metro: L1/L3 Espanya, L5 Sants Estació. Body conditioning classes: Mondays 7:00-8:00pm. Contact: WhatsApp or email through our website.`,

En pocos días tu body y tu energía se adaptarán... ¡y te encantará la sensación de arrancar el día así!`,
  bailemanananasFaqQ2: `¿Qué pasa si by las mañanas tengo poca energía o motivación?`,

  fullBodyCardioWhatIsTitle: `What is Cuerpo-Fit and why does it work?`,
  fullBodyCardioWhatIsP1: `Cuerpo-Fit is the workout that changes the fitness game in Barcelona. Imagine combining the intensity of full body training with the energy of cardio dance, all in 60 minutes that fly by. It's not a gym. It's not a conventional dance class. It's the best of both worlds.`,
  fullBodyCardioWhatIsP2: `Born from the physical conditioning used by our academy's professional dancers, we've adapted their techniques so anyone—regardless of their level—can benefit. The result: a stronger, more agile and more toned body, without the monotony of machines.`,
  fullBodyCardioWhatIsP3: `Each session is designed to work your entire body: legs, glutes, core, arms and back. But here's the trick: we do it to the rhythm of music, with functional exercises that mimic dance movements. You burn between 400 and 500 calories without realizing you're training.`,
  fullBodyCardioWhatIsP4: `Cuerpo-Fit is for you if the gym bores you, if you want real results without suffering, or if you're simply looking for a fun way to get fit. Zero previous experience needed. Just the desire to move.`,
  fullBodyCardioWhatIsQuestionTitle: `Tired of boring workouts that don't work?`,

  fullBodyCardioCulturalShort: `Cuerpo-Fit fuses full body functional training with cardio dance elements, based on scientific principles of calorie burning and muscle toning.`,
  fullBodyCardioCulturalFull: `### El origen for Cuerpo-Fit\n\n**Cuerpo-Fit nació en Farray's Center Barcelona como respuesta a una necesidad real: ofrecer el acondicionamiento físico de bailarines profesionales a personas que no bailan.** Los bailarines de élite mantienen cuerpos fuertes, ágiles y resistentes without stepping foot in a conventional gym. ¿Su secreto? Functional training with music.\n\n**"Cuerpo-Fit: method de full body training + cardio dance desarrollado en Farray's Center Barcelona (2023), quema 400-500 kcal/session."**\n\n### Por qué funciona: la ciencia del Full Body\n\n**El full body training activa más del 60% de la masa muscular en cada session**, lo que dispara el gasto calórico y acelera el metabolismo. A diferencia de las rutinas divididas de gimnasio, el full body:\n\n- **Burn más calories** en menos tiempo\n- **Mejora la coordinación** entre groups musculares\n- **Reduce el riesgo de lesiones** by imbalances\n- **Aumenta la fuerza funcional** for daily activities\n\n**"Full Body Training: activa +60% masa muscular, quema 400-500 kcal/hora, mejora coordinación y fuerza funcional."**\n\n### El factor cardio dance: diversión que quema\n\n**Cuando añades music y ritmo al entrenamiento, el cerebro libera más dopamina y endorfinas.** Estudios demuestran que el exercise with music:\n\n- **Reduce la percepción del esfuerzo** hasta un 12%\n- **Aumenta la adherencia** al programa de entrenamiento\n- **Mejora la coordinación motriz** y la memoria muscular\n- **Potencia el estado de ánimo** post-ejercicio\n\n**"Cardio Dance: exercise with music reduce percepción esfuerzo -12%, aumenta adherencia +40%, potencia endorfinas."**\n\n### Cuerpo-Fit: la fusión perfecta\n\n**En Cuerpo-Fit combinamos ejercicios funcionales de alta efectividad with la energía del cardio dance:**\n\n- **Ejercicios compound** (sentadillas, lunges, burpees adaptados)\n- **Core training** (plancha, trabajo abdominal dinámico)\n- **Cardio intervals** (intensity peaks to the rhythm of music)\n- **Movimientos de danza** (desplazamientos, coordinación)\n\nTodo secuenciado en 60 minutos que trabajan cada músculo de tu body while the music keeps you motivated.\n\n**"Method Cuerpo-Fit (Barcelona): fusión full body + cardio dance; 60 min, ~450 kcal, todos los levels."**\n\n### Resultados esperados\n\nWith regular practice for Cuerpo-Fit (1-2 times per week):\n\n- **Semanas 1-2**: Más energía, mejor humor, menos estrés\n- **Semanas 3-4**: Ropa que empieza a quedar diferente, más fuerza\n- **Semanas 5-8**: Cambios visibles en tonificación, resistencia mejorada\n- **Meses 2-3**: Transformación notable, nuevos hábitos consolidados\n\n**"Cuerpo-Fit results: +energía (week 1), cambios visibles (month 1), transformation (months 2-3)."**`,

  fullBodyCardioFaqTitle: `Frequently Asked Questions about Cuerpo-Fit`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ1: `How many calories do you burn in Cuerpo-Fit?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA1: `En una session for Cuerpo-Fit de 60 minutos se queman aproximadamente <strong>400-500 calories</strong>, dependiendo de tu peso e intensidad. Es equivalente a 45 minutos de running, but much more fun and with less impact on the joints. The combined work of cardio and toning keeps your metabolism active even after class (EPOC effect).`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ2: `Do I need to know how to dance to do Cuerpo-Fit?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA2: `No. Cuerpo-Fit is not a dance class, it's functional training with music. The movements are fitness exercises (squats, lunges, core...) sequenced to the rhythm of music. There are no choreographies to memorize. If you can walk, you can do Cuerpo-Fit.`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ3: `What's the difference between Cuerpo-Fit and the gym?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA3: `<strong>Cuerpo-Fit</strong>: group training with music, functional exercises, without machines, guaranteed fun, adapted in real time. <strong>Gym</strong>: isolated machines, monotonous repetitions, without guidance (usually). Same caloric expenditure, but Cuerpo-Fit has better adherence because it's not boring.`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ4: `What clothes should I wear to Cuerpo-Fit?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA4: `<strong>Required clothing</strong>: ropa deportiva cómoda (leggings, camiseta transpirable), zapatillas de deporte. <strong>Recomendado</strong>: toalla pequeña, botella de agua. <strong>No necesitas</strong>: special dance clothes or extra equipment (we provide everything).`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ5: `Is it suitable for absolute beginners?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA5: `Sí, 100%. Cuerpo-Fit is open level designed for everyone. Each exercise has <strong>3 intensity levels</strong>: bajo (principiantes), medio (intermedios), alto (avanzados). Tú eliges en cada momento. Cris adapts and corrects in real time. Many of our students started without having set foot in a gym in years.`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ6: `How often should I do Cuerpo-Fit to see results?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA6: `Con <strong>1 weekly class</strong> ya notarás cambios en energía y ánimo. For visible toning results, we recommend <strong>2 sesiones semanales</strong> (you can combine with other classes at the academy). La constancia es más importante que the intensity. Better 1 class each week for months than 5 classes one week and then nothing.`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ7: `Can I do Cuerpo-Fit if I'm overweight?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA7: `Sí. Cuerpo-Fit is especially effective for people who want to lose weight because: it works the whole body (more caloric expenditure), the exercises are low impact (they take care of the joints), and each movement has lower intensity variations. Many students with excess weight choose Cuerpo-Fit precisely because they don't feel judged and can go at their own pace.`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ8: `What muscles do I work in Cuerpo-Fit?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA8: `Cuerpo-Fit es <strong>full body</strong>, works all major muscle groups: <strong>Tren inferior</strong>: cuádriceps, isquiotibiales, glúteos, gemelos. <strong>Core</strong>: abdominales, oblicuos, espalda baja. <strong>Tren superior</strong>: arms, shoulders, back, chest. En 60 minutos activamos más del 60% de tu masa muscular total.`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ9: `How long does it take to see results?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA9: `<strong>Semanas 1-2</strong>: más energía, mejor humor, mejor sueño. <strong>Semanas 3-4</strong>: clothes start to fit differently, more strength in daily activities. <strong>Meses 1-2</strong>: cambios visibles en tonificación, resistencia cardiovascular mejorada. <strong>Mes 3+</strong>: transformation notable, nuevos hábitos consolidados. Resultados with practice regular de 1-2 times per week.`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ10: `¿Hay classes for Cuerpo-Fit for mayores de 40 o 50 years?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA10: `Sí, tenemos alumnos de todas las edades, desde 20 to 60+ years. Cuerpo-Fit is especially recommended for people over 40 because: it maintains muscle mass (which starts to be lost with age), improves bone density, is low impact (takes care of joints), and each exercise adapts to your level. Age is not an excuse, it's a reason to start.`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ11: `¿Cómo es una class típica for Cuerpo-Fit?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA11: `<strong>Calentamiento (10 min)</strong>: activación cardiovascular suave, movilidad articular. <strong>Bloque principal (40 min)</strong>: circuitos de full body exercises al ritmo de la music, combinando cardio y tonificación, with pausas activas. <strong>Vuelta a la calma (10 min)</strong>: estiramientos, respiración, relajación. All guided by Cris with motivating music in the background.`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ12: `What intensity level does the class have?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA12: `Intensidad <strong>moderada-alta</strong>, pero siempre adaptable. Cuerpo-Fit works with the principle of "choose your intensity": cada ejercicio tiene versión suave (principiantes), media (intermedios) e intensa (avanzados). Tú decides en cada momento cuánto das. La idea es que termines sudando pero sonriendo, no arrastrándote.`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ13: `Can I do Cuerpo-Fit if I have injuries?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA13: `Depende de la lesión. <strong>Requisitos</strong>: consult with your doctor or physiotherapist first. If you have medical clearance, let us know before class to adapt exercises. <strong>Contraindicaciones absolutas</strong>: lesiones agudas, problemas cardíacos no controlados, embarazo de riesgo. Cris can modify exercises for most common limitations (knees, back, shoulders).`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqQ14: `¿Cuánto cuesta la class for Cuerpo-Fit?`,
  fullBodyCardioFaqA14: `Cuerpo-Fit is included in the academy's monthly memberships. <strong>Trial class</strong>: consulta condiciones actuales en recepción o web. <strong>Bono mensual</strong>: gives you access to Cuerpo-Fit and other classes at the academy. <strong>No commitment</strong>: you pay month to month, without commitment.

And I can guarantee you one thing: <strong>nobody cares about your level</strong>. Everyone is focused on their own process.`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_section1ListTitle: `It doesn't matter if:`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_list1Item1: `You've never danced and feel "stiff as a board"`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_list1Item2: `You're embarrassed to make mistakes`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_list1Item3: `You're worried about coming alone`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_list1Item4: `You think you "have no rhythm"`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_section1Conclusion: `Here the rule is simple: <strong>nobody judges you</strong>, and everyone started the same way.`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_section2Title: `How your first class works (step by step)`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_section2Intro: `So you come with confidence, here's how it typically works:`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_section2ListTitle: `Steps for your first class:`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_paso1: `<strong>You arrive and we get you situated:</strong> Our staff welcomes you, explains how the space works and guides you according to your goal (social, urban, technique, etc.).`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_paso2: `<strong>You choose your real level:</strong> Zero is a valid level. There are classes for beginners and also people who repeat basics to improve. You do your thing.`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_paso3: `<strong>You start moving without overthinking:</strong> The first victory isn't doing it perfectly. It's doing it.`,

  blogClasesPrincipiantes_section5Title: `The rule that makes you improve (and almost nobody applies)`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_section5Content: `In dance there's a formula that never fails: <strong>repetition + consistency</strong>. Your body learns like it learns a language: at first you think too much, you get stuck, you get frustrated… and suddenly one day it happens: you start doing steps without thinking. That's called <strong>muscle memory</strong>. And it's the moment when dancing stops being effort and becomes pleasure.`,
  blogClasesPrincipiantes_section5Tip: `**Realistic tip:** better 2 days a week for 2 months than one intense week and then disappearing.`,

  blogClasesPrincipiantes_section6Conclusion: `If you compare yourself, you lose. Your useful comparison is this: <strong>me today vs me 3 weeks ago</strong>.`,
