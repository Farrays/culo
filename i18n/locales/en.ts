  philosophyBody1:
    'No effort will bring you more benefits than learning and practicing a dance. The endorphins you produce while dancing generate an immediate increase in serotonin, and with it, your level of well-being. When you dance, you smile more, you like yourself more, you are more sociable, more flexible, and more understanding. If there is one thing capable of changing your life from the very first moment, it is, without a doubt, dancing.',
  philosophyBody2:
    "More than a conventional dance school, what Yunaisy Farray and her team offer is a center that reflects their artistic ideals and way of life. The activities at Farray's International Dance Center are distinguished by following an exclusive and unique method created by Yunaisy Farray, which ensures fast, solid, and proven results.",

You'll find our center in a vibrant area with cafes and shops all around.",
  homeFaqQ2: "What sets Farray's apart from other dance academies in Barcelona?",
  homeFaqA2:
    "Farray's is not just another school: it was born from a love story for dance. We renovated a space abandoned for 10 years with our own hands because the school we dreamed of didn't exist. We're accredited by CID-UNESCO, we use the exclusive Farray Method® created by Yunaisy (dancer in Street Dance 2 and Got Talent), and above all, every student matters here. You're not a number: you're part of the family.",

  // Dancehall FAQ
  dancehallFaqQ1: 'What exactly is dancehall?',
  dancehallFaqA1:
    "Dancehall is a style of music and dance that originated in Jamaica in the 70s. It's characterized by energetic movements, powerful rhythms ('riddims'), and a bold, confident attitude. It's much more than just steps: it's a complete cultural expression with its own history, music, and community. In our classes, you don't just learn the movements but also the culture and context behind them.",
  dancehallFaqQ2: 'Is dancehall difficult to learn?',
  dancehallFaqA2:
    'No more than any other dance style. Dancehall may seem intimidating at first due to its energy and rhythm, but our pedagogical approach breaks down each movement step by step. We start with the fundamentals (grooves, basic riddims) and advance gradually. Most of our beginner students are dancing full choreographies within a few weeks. The most important thing is attitude and the desire to have fun.',
  dancehallFaqQ3: 'Do I need to be in shape for dancehall classes?',
  dancehallFaqA3:
    "You don't need to be in specific shape to start. Dancehall itself is an excellent cardiovascular and endurance workout, so you'll improve your physical condition with each class. We work at different intensities and you can always adapt the movements to your current level. The important thing is to listen to your body and progress at your own pace.",
  dancehallFaqQ4: 'What should I wear to dancehall class?',
  dancehallFaqA4:
    "Comfortable, sporty clothing that allows you to move freely. Many students wear athletic pants or leggings and a t-shirt. For footwear, clean athletic shoes with good soles are ideal. Bring a water bottle because you're going to sweat! Optional: a small towel and your best attitude.",

  // Classes FAQ
  classesFaqQ1: "How many dance styles do you teach at Farray's Center?",
  classesFaqA1:
    'We offer training in over 25 different dance styles. Our catalog includes Latin dances (salsa, bachata, kizomba), urban dance (hip hop, dancehall, afrobeats, reggaeton), classical styles (ballet, contemporary, jazz), and specializations like physical preparation for dancers. This variety allows you to explore different styles and find those that resonate most with you, or specialize in one while complementing with others.',
  classesFaqQ2: 'Can I take classes in different styles at the same time?',
  classesFaqA2:
    'Of course! In fact, we recommend it. Learning multiple dance styles makes you a more complete and versatile dancer. For example, ballet improves your posture and technique for salsa, while hip hop can make your bachata more dynamic. Our class packages allow you to attend different types of classes according to your interests. Many of our most advanced students practice 3-4 styles simultaneously.',
  classesFaqQ3: 'How do I know which level is right for me?',
  classesFaqA3:
    "If it's your first class, we always recommend starting at the fundamentals or beginner level. However, if you have previous dance experience, our instructors can assess you in your first trial class and recommend the most appropriate level. You can also try an intermediate level class if you feel the fundamentals are too basic. The important thing is that you feel challenged but not overwhelmed.",
  classesFaqQ4: 'How often should I attend classes to see progress?',
  classesFaqA4:
    'For consistent and noticeable progress, we recommend attending at least twice a week. At this frequency, most students see significant improvements in 2-3 months. If you can attend 3-4 times a week, progress will be even faster. However, even a weekly class will allow you to advance, albeit at a more gradual pace. Consistency is more important than intensity.',
  classesFaqQ5: 'Do you offer private or only group classes?',

    "We offer both options. Group classes are excellent for learning in community, making friends, and benefiting from the group's energy. Private classes are ideal if you seek personalized attention, have specific goals (like preparing for a presentation or wedding), or prefer a more flexible schedule. Many students combine both: regular group classes supplemented with occasional private sessions to work on specific aspects.",

  dhV3WhatIsTitle: 'What is Dancehall and why is it taking Barcelona by storm?',
  dhV3WhatIsP1:
    'Dancehall is a traditional Jamaican dance born in the 70s that reflects a culture with strong roots in reggae, African and Caribbean references, and the energy of hip-hop and other urban dances.',
  dhV3WhatIsP2:
    "Dancehall is much more than a dance: it's a way of walking, talking, and understanding life; a declaration of who you are. It's pure expression, rhythm, attitude, and flow. In Dancehall you don't have to be good, you have to be yourself.",
  dhV3WhatIsP3:
    'The contagious rhythms of Dancehall spread rapidly around the world, along with an attractive, energetic, and sensual dance style.',
  dhV3WhatIsP4:
    'Barcelona has become one of the most active Dancehall hubs in Europe, where culture and diversity are lived in every neighborhood.',
  dhV3WhatIsQuestionTitle: "Wondering if it's for you?",
  dhV3WhatIsQuestionAnswer: 'Yes, it is.',

  dhV3CulturalTitle: 'Dancehall History and Culture',
  dhV3CulturalShort:
    'Dancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 70s as a natural evolution of reggae.',
  dhV3CulturalFull:
    '### The origins: Kingston, Jamaica (1970s–1980s)\n\nDancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 70s. It emerged as a natural evolution of reggae when sound systems (mobile sound systems) began taking music to the streets and dancehalls. The name "dancehall" comes from those spaces where the community gathered to dance, socialize, and express themselves. It was where social tensions were released through music and movement.\n\n### The legends: Bogle, Passa Passa, and the pioneers\n\nGerald "Bogle" Levy (1964–2005) is considered the father of modern Dancehall. He created iconic moves like Bogle, Row Di Boat, Log On, and Willie Bounce, the foundation of the Dancehall vocabulary. Passa Passa, the legendary street dancehall sessions in Tivoli Gardens (Kingston), was the epicenter where new steps were born and dancers were consecrated. Other pioneers like Ding Dong, Keiva, John Hype, and crews like Ravers Clavers took Dancehall international in the 2000s.\n\n### Global expansion (2000s–present)\n\nIn the 2000s, Dancehall exploded globally thanks to artists like Sean Paul, Shaggy, Elephant Man, and Beenie Man. Social media and YouTube popularized steps like Dutty Wine, Daggering, and Nuh Linga. Today, Dancehall is a worldwide phenomenon with active communities in Europe, Africa, Asia, and America; Barcelona is one of its European epicenters.\n\n### The music: Riddims and Sound System culture\n\nDancehall is danced to riddims (instrumental bases) that producers create and multiple artists voice over. Legendary riddims like Diwali, Coolie Dance, or Dump Truck defined entire eras. Sound system culture—with its selectors, MCs, and the famous rewind when a song is so good it gets replayed from the start—is essential to understanding Dancehall.\n\n### More than dance: identity and resistance\n\nDancehall has always been a form of cultural resistance and identity expression for Jamaica\'s marginalized communities. It\'s the voice of the ghettos, a celebration of joy despite difficulties. Each step has meaning: Log On (connect), Willie Bounce (tribute to Willie Haggart), Nuh Linga (don\'t delay). Every movement tells a story.',

  // What is Urban Dance Section
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_title: 'What is Urban Dance?',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_definition:
    'Urban dances are dance styles born in the streets, plazas and neighborhoods of different cities around the world. They\'re called "urban" because they emerged outside theaters and academies: in the Bronx (Hip Hop), Jamaica (Dancehall), South Korea (K-Pop), Cuba (Reggaeton), Ghana and Nigeria (Afrobeat), and in nightclubs worldwide (Heels, Twerk, Sexy Style).',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_origin:
    'The term "urban dance" groups a huge family of styles that share common DNA: they were born from popular culture, transmitted by imitation in the streets and evolved with contemporary urban music (rap, reggae, dancehall, trap, afrobeats). Unlike classical dance (ballet, contemporary, jazz), urban dances prioritize groove, musicality, attitude and personal expression over academic technique.',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_difference_title:
    'Difference between "Urban Dance", "Street Dance" and "Commercial Dance"',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_difference_urban:
    'Urban Dance: Generic term for all dance styles born in urban and street contexts. Includes Hip Hop, Breaking, Popping, Locking, Krump, House, Dancehall, Afrobeat, etc.',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_difference_street:
    'Street Dance: Refers specifically to styles originally danced in the street and in battles (cyphers). E.g.: Breaking, Popping, Locking, Krump. These styles have battle codes, improvisation (freestyle) and competition.',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_difference_commercial:
    'Commercial Dance: Urban style choreographed and polished for the entertainment industry: music videos, concerts, TV shows. Mixes technique from different urban styles with elements of jazz, contemporary and commercial influences. E.g.: K-Pop choreographies, Heels, mainstream artist music videos.',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_why_many_styles:
    'So many different styles exist because each was born in a unique cultural, geographical and musical context. Hip Hop emerged in the Bronx, New York with rap culture and breakdancing. Dancehall was born in Jamaica with soundsystems and reggae music. K-Pop evolved in South Korea fusing Western pop with Asian aesthetics. Afrobeat connects with modern African rhythms from Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa. Each style tells a different story, has its own codes and is danced with distinct energy.',

    "At Farray's Center we teach Cuban Salsa, Sensual Bachata, Bachata Lady Style, Cuban Timba, Son Cubano, Salsa Lady Style, Salsa Lady Timba, Men Style and Cuban Folklore. Our teachers are graduates of the National School of Art of Cuba and have experience in Havana's best academies, guaranteeing authenticity and quality in every class.",

  salsaBachataFaqQ2: 'Do I need to bring a partner for salsa or bachata classes?',
  salsaBachataFaqA2:
    "No, you don't need to bring a partner. In our partner dance classes (salsa, bachata, timba) we constantly rotate so everyone has the opportunity to dance with different partners. This helps you develop your connection technique and feel comfortable dancing with anyone. We also offer individual Lady Style and Men Style classes if you prefer to focus on your personal technique.",

  salsaBachataFaqQ3: "What's the difference between Cuban Salsa and other salsa styles?",
  salsaBachataFaqA3:
    'Cuban Salsa is danced in a circle and has a more circular, joyful and "street" style compared to Salsa on Line (LA Style or NY Style). Cuban incorporates Afro-Cuban, son and rumba movements. It\'s very social: you can dance in rueda de casino (several dancers in a circle) or in pairs. At Farray\'s we teach authentic Cuban salsa with teachers from Havana.',

  salsaBachataFaqQ4: 'What level do I need to start salsa or bachata classes?',
  salsaBachataFaqA4:
    "None. We have classes for all levels: Beginner (you've never danced), Basic (you know the basic steps), Intermediate (you dance fluently and know figures) and Advanced (you master technique and musicality). If you've never danced salsa or bachata, start in our Beginner classes where we teach you from scratch: basic step, musical timing, partner connection and first figures.",

  salsaBachataFaqQ5: 'How long does it take to learn to dance salsa or bachata?',
  salsaBachataFaqA5:
    "It depends on your dedication, but with consistent practice (2-3 classes per week) you can dance confidently in 2-3 months. To master the technique, advanced musicality and complex figures, we recommend at least 6-12 months. Many of our advanced students have been perfecting their style for years and never stop learning. What's important is to enjoy the process from day one.",

  salsaBachataFaqQ6: "What's the difference between Sensual Bachata and Bachata Lady Style?",
  salsaBachataFaqA6:
    'Sensual Bachata is danced in pairs with connection, body waves, dips and isolations inspired by zouk and contemporary. Bachata Lady Style focuses on individual feminine dancing: footwork technique, hip movement, arms, waves and attitude, perfect for shining alone on the dance floor or perfecting your technique before partner dancing. Both complement each other: Sensual for connection, Lady Style for personal technique.',

  salsaBachataFaqQ7: 'Do salsa and bachata classes include live music?',
  salsaBachataFaqA7:
    "Our regular classes use recorded music from the best salsa and bachata artists (Celia Cruz, El Gran Combo, Marc Anthony, Romeo Santos, Prince Royce, etc.). However, we organize special events, Latin parties and workshops with live musicians where you can practice what you've learned in a festive and authentic atmosphere. We also collaborate with salsa festivals in Barcelona.",

  salsaBachataFaqQ8: 'Do you offer Rueda de Casino classes?',
  salsaBachataFaqA8:
    'Yes, Rueda de Casino is an integral part of our Cuban Salsa classes. Rueda is a modality where multiple couples dance in a circle and a "cantante" (caller) announces the figures that everyone executes at the same time. It\'s very fun, social and traditional in Cuba. To dance rueda you need to first master the basic steps of Cuban salsa and the main figures.',

  salsaBachataFaqQ9: 'Where is the salsa and bachata school located?',
  salsaBachataFaqA9:
    'We are at Calle Entença 100, 08015 Barcelona, just 5 minutes walk from Plaza España and Sants Station. Metro: L1 (Hostafrancs) / L3 (Tarragona, Plaza España). Train: Sants Estació. Buses: 13, 37, 65, 79, 109, 165. We have spacious, air-conditioned rooms with special dance flooring.',

  salsaBachataFaqQ10: 'Can I try a salsa or bachata class before enrolling?',
  salsaBachataFaqA10:
    'Depending on the season, the trial class for residents may be free or have a symbolic welcome price. The idea is that you can experience our methodology, meet the teachers and feel the energy of our dance academy without commitment. Book your spot by clicking the "Book Your Trial Class" button at the top of this page.',

  // Point 1 - What is Salsa y Bachata Section
  salsaBachata_whatIs_title: 'What is Salsa Cubana and Bachata?',
  salsaBachata_whatIs_salsa:
    "Salsa Cubana is much more than a dance: it's a cultural expression born in Cuba that fuses Afro-Caribbean rhythms (son, rumba, mambo, cha-cha-cha) with jazz and other styles. It's characterized by circular movements in pairs (rueda de casino), quick footwork, free body expression and a deep connection with the music. It's the most social and festive salsa style, perfect for group dancing and enjoying improvisation.",
  salsaBachata_whatIs_bachata:
    "Bachata is a sensual and romantic dance originating from the Dominican Republic. It was born in working-class neighborhoods in the 1960s and evolved to become one of the most popular Latin dances in the world. It's danced in pairs with marked hip movements, simple basic steps (side-to-side with tap) and fluid turns. There are several styles: Dominican Bachata (traditional), Sensual Bachata (modern, with body waves) and Bachata Fusion.",
  salsaBachata_whatIs_difference_title: 'Difference between Salsa Cubana and Salsa on Line',
  salsaBachata_whatIs_difference_text:
    'Salsa Cubana is danced in a circle (rueda de casino), with freer and more Afro-Caribbean movements, ideal for parties and social dancing. Salsa on Line (LA or New York style) is danced in a straight line, with more technical choreographies and spectacular turns, perfect for shows and exhibitions. Both styles share the same music, but the dancing philosophy is different.',
  salsaBachata_whatIs_benefits:
    "Dancing Salsa and Bachata improves your coordination, rhythm, cardiovascular fitness, social confidence and cultural connection. It's a fun way to exercise, meet new people and immerse yourself in Latin culture. Additionally, you develop musicality, body expression and leadership/following skills in partnership.",

  // Cultural Section
  twerkCulturalShort:
    "Twerk didn't appear overnight. It was born from a mix of Afro-descendant influences: movements from traditional African dances such as 'baikoko mapouka', from New Orleans bounce culture and other urban styles that already worked a lot on the hips and the \"booty\".",
  twerkCulturalFull:
    '### The Origins: Africa, Caribbean and the Southern U.S.\n\nBefore Instagram existed and before anyone labeled it "twerk", there were already women (and men) moving their hips and glutes in African and Caribbean dances. Many of the movements we call Twerk today come from traditional rhythms and dances of West Africa such as \'baikoko mapouka\' and from the African diaspora in the Caribbean: pelvic movements, vibrations, isolations and hip work linked to rituals, celebrations and popular festivals.\n\nWith the arrival of these peoples to the United States, that body memory mixed with new music and contexts. In the south of the country, especially in New Orleans, that mix exploded.\n\n### New Orleans Bounce: Where Twerk Gets Its Name and Attitude\n\nModern Twerk as we know it is closely linked to New Orleans Bounce, a hip hop subgenre born in the late 80s and early 90s. In the clubs and block parties of the city, the audience —especially Black women— began to develop a dance style focused on glute, leg and pelvis work, with lots of energy, endurance and attitude.\n\nArtists like DJ Jubilee, Big Freedia and Cheeky Blakk popularized not only the sound, but also the movement. That\'s where Twerk stops being "just another step" and becomes its own style: physical, explosive and unapologetically free.\n\n### From the Clubs to the World: Global Expansion of Twerk\n\nFrom the 2000s, with the power of music videos and, later, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, Twerk went global. It appeared in mainstream artist videos, on tours of major pop stars and on stages around the world. What was once almost "local" to New Orleans became part of the international urban vocabulary.\n\nIn Europe and Latin America it crossed with other styles like Dancehall, Reggaeton and Hip Hop, and Twerk schools, battles and workshops started popping up everywhere. Today, Twerk is no longer "just a trend": it has technique, schools, competitions and its own pedagogy.\n\n### The Music of Twerk: Bounce, Hip Hop, Trap and More\n\nAlthough Twerk was born closely tied to Bounce, today it\'s danced to a wide variety of beats: New Orleans Bounce, Hip Hop and Trap, Dancehall and Afrobeats, Reggaeton and other Latin urban rhythms. What matters is not just the strong, marked beat, but the "pumping" sensation that allows for bounces, vibrations and rhythm changes. Each beat invites a different type of energy: more aggressive, more sensual or more festive.\n\n### Much More Than Moving Your Glutes: Body, Identity and Power\n\nReducing Twerk to "moving your butt" is to understand absolutely nothing. Twerk, as we teach it at serious schools like Farray\'s, is about: body awareness (learning to isolate, control and protect your body), physical strength (strong legs, core and glutes; endurance and coordination), identity and self-esteem (reconciling with your body, your shape, your rhythm and your desire), and empowerment (deciding how you move, how you show yourself and what story your dance tells).\n\nFor many women (and men too), Twerk is a way to regain control over their image and body, instead of dancing "to please others". At Farray\'s International Dance Center, Twerk is taught with technique, respect and context: it\'s not a circus for filming "attention-grabbing" videos, but a tool for gaining strength, confidence and stage presence, in a caring, professional and human environment.',

  // Cultural History

  afroCulturalShort:
    'Afrobeats (plural) emerged in the late 90s and early 2000s between Nigeria and Ghana. It is not a single genre, but an urban current that mixes African rhythms with highlife, hip hop, R&B, dancehall and pop.',
  afroCulturalFull: `### Origins: Lagos, Accra and the New African Wave

Afrobeats (plural) emerged in the late 90s and early 2000s between Nigeria and Ghana. It is not a single genre, but an urban current that mixes African rhythms with highlife, hip hop, R&B, dancehall and pop. The result is a recognizable sound: marked percussion, powerful bass, catchy melodies and unforgettable choruses.

### From Fela Kuti to Current Afrobeats

Before this modern wave, in the 60s and 70s, Fela Kuti revolutionized Nigerian music originating Afrobeat (singular): a fusion of jazz, funk, highlife and Yoruba rhythms with messages of social and political protest, extended songs and immersive instrumental structures. Current Afrobeats takes rhythmic elements from Afrobeat, but adapts them to shorter songs, digital production and an orientation to international consumption for radio and clubs.

### From Sound to Movement: Afrodance

The musical rise of Afrobeats brought new dance forms: what is now defined as Afrodance or afro urban dances. These movements were born in streets and clubs of Lagos, Accra or Johannesburg, and some viral examples have been:

• Azonto (Ghana): hips, shoulders and everyday gestures.

• Etighi, Shoki, Shaku Shaku, Zanku/Legwork (Nigeria): intense footwork, knee bounce and relaxed arms.

These dances go viral globally through YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. Additionally, from Gabon has recently emerged Ntcham or Tcham Bolo, a musical and urban dance expression originating in the popular neighborhoods and prisons of Libreville, combining afrobeat roots with local sounds and reflecting the reality and resilience of Gabonese youth.

### Global Expansion: From Lagos to Barcelona

Since the 2000s, artists like Wizkid, Davido, Tiwa Savage and Burna Boy have taken Afrobeats out of Africa, collaborating with international pop and rap stars. Festivals, clubs and digital platforms have transformed this genre into a symbol of new African culture, influencing music, dance, fashion and attitude worldwide.

In cities like Barcelona, the Afrodance community is growing rapidly. More and more people seek to connect with the energy and flow characteristic of these dances full of bounce, footwork and collective celebration.

### More than a Trend: Identity and Community

Although Afrodance may be seen a lot on social media, its root is deep: it is a manifestation of pride, joy, humor, sensuality and African feeling. Each step breathes intention: play, power, enjoyment. Afrobeats and Afrodance connect with the basic instinct to move, share energy, and feel part of a global identity, even if you are far from Lagos or Accra.`,

  hhrCulturalShort:
    "Hip Hop Reggaeton is a fusion of two iconic styles: American hip-hop and Latin reggaeton. At Farray's we've created a unique style that combines the best of both worlds.",
  hhrCulturalFull: `### Hip Hop Origins

Hip-hop was born in the Bronx of New York in the 70s, as an artistic expression of African-American and Latino communities. From breakdance to popping and locking, hip-hop revolutionized the way of moving and expressing through dance.

### Reggaeton: Latin Rhythm

Reggaeton emerged in Puerto Rico in the 90s, fusing Jamaican reggae with Latin rhythms and hip-hop. Its characteristic "dembow" and sensual movements made it a global phenomenon.

### Farray's Unique Fusion

At Farray's International Dance Center we've created our own style that fuses both worlds: the technique and swagger of hip-hop with the sensuality and rhythm of reggaeton. The result is a modern, informal and explosive dance that allows you to express your unique personality.

### A Constantly Evolving Style

The latest trends and styles merge in our classes in a varied, dynamic and fun way. We incorporate elements from current music videos, viral movements from social media and the essence of both genres to create fresh and original choreographies every week.`,

  rcbWhatIsP1:
    'Cuban Reggaeton, also known as Cubatón or Reparto, is the authentic reggaeton that was born and evolved in the streets of Cuba.',
  rcbWhatIsP2:
    "Unlike the commercial reggaeton you see in music videos, Cuban reggaeton is characterized by improvisation, extreme body dissociation, and a rawer, street style. It's not just following a choreography: it's feeling the music and letting your body respond.",
  rcbWhatIsP3:
    '"In Cuba, we don\'t dance to impress. We dance to feel. And that\'s what we teach here."',
  rcbWhatIsP4:
    "You'll learn to dissociate every part of your body, improvise with the music, and develop your own style. Because Cuban reggaeton isn't copied: it's lived.",
  rcbWhatIsQuestionTitle: 'Tired of commercial reggaeton where everyone dances the same?',
  rcbWhatIsQuestionAnswer: 'Then this is for you.',
  rcbCulturalShort:
    'Cuban reggaeton has its roots in the neighborhoods of Havana, where the fusion of Jamaican reggae with Afro-Cuban rhythms created a unique street style.',
  rcbCulturalFull:
    '### Origins in the streets of Cuba\n\nCuban reggaeton was born in the 90s in the working-class neighborhoods of Havana, as a result of the fusion between Jamaican reggae that arrived by radio and traditional Afro-Cuban rhythms. Unlike the more commercial Puerto Rican reggaeton, Cuban reggaeton maintained its street essence and emphasis on improvisation.\n\n### Reparto: the neighborhood style\n\nThe term "Reparto" comes from the neighborhoods (repartos) where this style was born. It\'s a rawer reggaeton, with more exaggerated movements and a more direct connection with the music. Reparto dancers are recognized for their improvisation skills and mastery of body dissociation.\n\n### Cubatón today\n\nToday, Cubatón has expanded internationally but maintains its essence: improvisation, flavor, and that unique energy that only comes from Cuba. Artists like Chocolate MC, El Chacal, and Jacob Forever have taken the Cuban sound worldwide, and with it, their way of dancing.',
